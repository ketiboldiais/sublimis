Statistics is the study, collection, analysis, interpretation, and
presentation of data. For example, consider the following _dot plot_:

<DotPlot
	data={[5, 5.5, 6, 6, 6, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 12]}
	xMin={3}
	xMax={13}
	xLabel={"\\text{hours of sleep}"}
	labelOffsetY={5}
	labelOffsetX={10}
	labelFontSize={0.6}
	marginLeft={10}
	id={"dotPlot1"}
/>

This plot visualizes the results of some survey on the hours of sleep the
respondents are getting. Does this tell us that most people are getting
about 6.5 hours of sleep? Does it tell us that 8 hours, as commonly
recommended, isn't all that common? That anything beyond 12 or less than 6
is "rare?" These are the kinds of questions that statistics answers.

There are two tasks usually done in statistics:

1. Organizing and summarizing data. The methods for accomplishing this task
   are collectively called **descriptive statistics**.
2. Drawing conclusions from data. The methods for accomplishing this task
   are collectively called **inferential statistics**.

With this introduction, let's define some basic terms in statistics.

## Population

In statistics, data is generally collected from some **population**. A
population is a set — a collection of entities or objects. The members of
this set might be people, companies, animals, dollars, and so on.

### Samples

Some populations are so large that we can't possibly collect data from
every single member of the population. For example, it's infeasible to
collect data from every single voter in the United States. Because of these
limitations, we instead select a **sample** of the population. A sample is
a subset of the larger population.

### Statistics

From the sample data, we can calculate one or more **statistics** — some
number representing a property of the sample. For example, from a survey of
a sample of college students, we might calculate the average grade point
average. Say that average is 3.5. The number 3.5 is a statistic — it's a
number that represents a property of the sample; namely, the average GPA.

### Parameters

All statistics are estimates of a **parameter** of the population. A
parameter is a property of the entire population. For example, the average
GPA calculated from the preceding example is an estimate of the average GPA
for _all_ college students.

### Representative Samples

Because all statistics are estimates of some parameter, a principal task in
statistics is answering the question: How accurate is this statistic in
estimating the parameter? Simply put, a statistic's accuracy depends on
whether the sample is a **representative sample**. A sample is considered
representative only if it contains the population's characteristics. For
example, if we wanted to know the average GPA for all biology majors, then
we should be surveying biology majors rather than just any major.

### Variables & Data

As mentioned earlier, populations have characteristics. Some of those
characteristics can be determined — e.g., how tall the population member
is, where the population member lives, yes or no to a particular question,
and so on. Each of these determinable characteristics is called a
**variable**.

In statistics, there are two kinds of variables:

1. A **numerical variable** is a variable that can be defined as a value of
   some unit. For example, weight in kilograms, height in meters, or time
   in seconds.
2. A **categorial variable** is a variable that places a person or object
   into a category. For example, the categories of all 50 U.S. states, the
   parties Democrat, Republican, or Independent, or the federal income tax
   brackets.

The values of these variables — numerical or categorical — are call
**data**.

## Categories of Data

Generally, data falls into two categories:

1. **Qualitative data** is data resulting from categorizing or describing
   population characteristics. For example, from a survey of the
   population, we might gather qualitiative data on the members' ethnic
   groups or the car they drive. Qualitative data is also called
   **categorical data**.
2. **Quantitive data** is data resulting from counting or measuring
   population characteristics. For example, from a survey of the
   population, we might gather quantitative data like the members' weights,
   yearly income, or the number of their dependents.

### Discrete & Continuous Data

Quantitative data consists of two further categories:

1. **Quantitative discrete data (QDD)** is quantiative data that results
   from counting. Because QDD results from counting, QDD ultimately
   consists of integers. For example, the number of junk mail an individual
   receives per day might be 0, 5, or 100, but not 4.8.
2. **Quantiative continuous data (QCD)** is quantitative data that results
   from measurement. As such, this data might take on _real number values_.
   For example, the lengths of phone calls might be 2.4, 1.8, or 6.7
   minutes.

### Random Sampling

Earlier, we mentioned how sampling is a principle concern of statistics. To
obtain a representative sample, we follow a key definition:

> _Definition_. Let ${x}$ be some sample of population ${P.}$ ${x}$ is a
> representative sample of ${P}$ if, and only if, ${x}$ has the same
> characteristics as ${P.}$

To satisfy this definition, statisticians employ **random sampling**. In
random sampling, a sample is chosen by ensuring that each member of the
population has an equal chance of being selected. There are many ways to
ensure this condition.

#### Simple Random Sampling

The easiest method is **simple random sampling**. With this approach, we
select a **sample size** ${n,}$ and from the population ${P,}$ we select
${n}$ members at random. How do we select at random? Well, if the members
consisted of people, we could write their names on slips of paper, put the
slips in a hat, and randomly pull from the hat.

A more sophisticated approach:

1. Select a sample ${S}$ comprising ${n}$ members from population ${P.}$
2. For each member member of ${S,}$ assign a two digit number.
3. Generate random numbers.
4. For each of the random numbers, the matching two digit numbers is a
   selection.

For example, suppose there are 20 voters in some district, and we want a
sample size of 10. For each of the voters, we assign the numbers 01, 02,
03, ..., 20. We then generate random numbers with either a calculator or
some other piece of software. The random number generator might yield
0.9829, 0.325, 0.1582, 0.0683, and so on. For each of these randomly
generated numbers, we read the first matching two digit number as a
selection. For example, from the preceding list, we see 0.1582, so the
voter assigned 15 is selected. We then see 0.06, so the voter assigned 06
is selected.

#### Stratified Sampling

Another random sampling method is **stratified sampling**. The procedure is
as follows:

1. Divide the population into ${n}$ groups.[^strata]
2. From each group, take a _proportionate_ number of members.

[^strata]: These groups are called **strata** (singular **stratum**).
