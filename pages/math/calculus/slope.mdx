# Slope

The graph of an equation is the set of all points with coordinates
satisfying the equation. For example, suppose we had the equation
${y = x^2 + 1}$. Does the point ${(3,10)}$ lie on the equation's graph?
Yes. Plugging ${(3,10)}$ into the equation ${y = x^2 + 1}$, we get
${10 = (3)^2 + 1 = 9 + 10}$, which is true. Thus, the point ${3,10}$ does
indeed lie on the graph.

At very small intervals, graphs can be viewed as lines. Lines can either
slant or remain straight, but in both cases, the line has a **slope**
&mdash; a number that measures the line's direction.

> Definition. Given two points, ${(x_1, y_1)}$ and ${(x_2, y_2)}$, the
> slope of the line passing through the two points is the number $m$:

$$
	m = \dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

For example, suppose we had two points, ${(-2,-1)}$ and ${(3,5)}$. On the
Cartesian plane, these two points appear as:

<Plot
	geo={[
		{type:'point', xy: [-2,1]},
		{type:'label', xy: [-4,2], id: "(-2,1)"},
		{type:'point', xy: [3,5]},
		{type:'label', xy: [3,5], id: "(3,5)"},
		{type:'line', start: [-2,1], end:[3,5]},
	]}
	id="2pointPlot"
/>

The line between these two points is:

$$
	m = \dfrac{5-1}{3-(-2)} = \dfrac{4}{5}
$$

Thus, the line between ${(-2,1)}$ and ${(3,5)}$ has a slope of
${\frac{4}{5}}$. The slope equation can also be written as:

$$
	m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
$$

The variable $\Delta y$ represents the change in $y$-coordinates
(${y_2 - y_1}$), and the variable $\Delta x$ represents the change in
$x$-coordinates (${x_2 - x_1}$).

## Comparing Slope

The slope $m$ of a line is a real number (${m \in \mathbb{R}}$). Thus, $m$
can be a member of only one of three subsets:

1. ${m \in \mathbb{R}^-}$
2. ${m = 0}$
3. ${m \in \mathbb{R}^+}$

If $m$ is a negative real number &mdash; ${m \in \mathbb{R}^-}$ &mdash;
then the line slants downwards to the right. If $m$ is a positive real
number &mdash; ${m \in \mathbb{R}^+}$ &mdash; then the line slants upwards
to the right. If ${m = 0}$, then the line is a perfectly straight
_horizontal_ line.

Given the Cartesian plane, one might wonder, aren't there two cases for
straight lines: (a) a vertical straight line or (b) a horizontal straight
line? Yes, there are indeed two cases, straight horizontal lines and
straight vertical lines. But, the slope is not defined for a vertical line.
If the two points share the same ordinate (the ${y \text{-coordinate}}$),
then the line is a horizontal line (e.g., ${(a,b), (c,b)}$). If, however,
the two points share the same abscissa (the ${x \text{-coordinate}}$), then
the line is a vertical line (e.g., ${(a,b), (a,c)}$), but the slope is not
defined. This is because calculating the slope for such a line would lead
to an undefined result:

$$
	m = \dfrac{b - c}{a - a} = \dfrac{b - c}{0}
$$

Does the magnitude, or size, of $m$ yield any inferences? Yes.
${\lvert m \rvert }$ represents the "steepness" of the line. The larger
${\lvert m \rvert }$ is, the steeper the line slants (i.e., tending towards
a straight vertical line), and the smaller ${\lvert m \rvert }$ is, the
less the line's steepness (i.e., tending towards a straight horizontal
line).

## The Point-Slope Formula

The slope formula can be rearranged in another form, yielding the
**point-slope formula**.

> _Formula_. Given a point $P_1{(x_1, y_1)}$, the equation of the line
> passing through ${P_1}$ is given by the equation:
>
> $$
> 	y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
> $$

Because of the point-slope formula, it follows that the equation of a
horizontal line is simply the ordinate of ${P_1}$. For example, suppose
${P_1 = (4, -2)}$. A horizontal line is a line where ${m = 0}$, so it
follows that the line's equation is:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		y - (-2) &= 0(x - 4)
		y &= -2
	\end{aligned}
$$

We know that a horizontal line will always have a slope of ${m = 0}$. For
vertical lines, only the $y$-coordinate varies, and the $x$-coordinate
remains the same. Thus, we can state more general rules for horizontal and
vertical lines:

> _Rule_. Given a point ${P_1(a,b)}$, the equation of a line passing
> through ${P_1}$ is ${y = b}$.

> _Rule_. Given a point ${P_2(a,b)}$, the equation of a line passing
> through ${P_2}$ is ${x = a}$.

## Slope-Intercept Formula

If we know that a line passes through the point ${(0,b)}$, then we can
derive yet another equation for a line: the **slope-intercept form**. Since
the line passes through ${(0,b)}$ (i.e., the line crosses the $y$-axis),
using the _point-slope formula_, we can conclude that ${y - b = m(x-0)}$.
Simplifying and adding $b$ to both sides of the equation, we obtain the
following rule.

> _Formula_. Given a line with slope $m$ and a $y$-intercept $b$, the
> equation of the line is given by the equation:
>
> $$
> 	y = mx + b
> $$

If we know that a point satisfies this equation, then it must be the case
that it lies on the line with the equation. Furthermore, whenever we see an
equation of this form, we should be immediately aware that the equation
graphically represents a line.

## Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

In geometry, we can easily notice that parallel lines slant in the same
direction (i.e., they have the same "steepness" to their slant):

<Plot
	functions={[
		{f: (x) => 2 * x, color: "var(--red)"},
		{f: (x) => 2 * x + 2, color: "var(--blue)"},
		{f: (x) => 2 * x - 2, color: "var(--green)"},
	]}
	id="parallel_lines"
/>

Because perpendicular lines have the same slant, in algebraic terms, the
lines have the same slope. Thus, given line ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm AB}}$
(where $A$ and $B$ are two arbitrary points on the line) with the slope
$m_1$ and the line ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm CD}}$ (where $C$ and $D$ are
two arbitary points on the line) with the slope $m_2$, the lines
${\overleftrightarrow{\rm AB}}$ and ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm CD}}$ are
parallel if, and only if, ${m_1 = m_2}$. In other words, two lines are
parallel, if and only if, they have the same slope.

In contrast, perpendicular lines slant in the exact opposite direction,
forming 90 degree angles:

<Plot
	functions={[
		{f: (x) => 2 * x + 3, color: "var(--red)"},
		{f: (x) => -0.5 * x - 3, color: "var(--blue)"},
	]}
	id="perpendicular_lines"
/>

Given that two lines are perpendicular if and only if they form 90 degree
angles, it follows that for a line to be parallel to another line, the
line's slope must be the negative reciprocal of the other line. Thus, given
a line ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm EF}}$ (where $E$ and $F$ are arbitrary
points on the line) with the slope $m_1$ and a line
${\overleftrightarrow{\rm GH}}$ (where $G$ and $H$ are arbirary points on
the line) with the slope $m_2$, lines ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm EF}}$ and
${\overleftrightarrow{\rm GH}}$ are perpendicular if, and only if,
${m_1 = - \dfrac{1}{m_2}}$.

To see why a perpendicular line's slope must be the negative reciprocal of
the other line, consider the following: First, suppose we have three lines,
$\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, and the vertical line ${x = 1}$. Now suppose that
${\ell_1 \perp \ell_2}$, ${\ell_1}$ has a slope ${m_1}$, and ${\ell_2}$ has
a slope ${m_2}$. Finally, suppose that ${\ell_1}$ and ${\ell_2}$ intersect
at the origin, ${(0,0)}$. The lines can be visually represented as:

<Fig
	link={"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1654218228/math/proof_perpendicular_lines_w4tk4l.svg"}
	caption={"Perpendicular lines"}
	width={"50"}
	imwidth={"441"}
	imheight={"455"}
/>


Since ${\ell_1 \perp \ell_2}$, we know that that the vertical line
${x = 1}$ intersects ${\ell_1}$ at ${(1, m_1)}$ and ${\ell_2}$ at
${(1,m_2).}$ This is because both lines have a ${\Delta x = 1.}$

Where ${\ell_1}$ and ${\ell_2}$ intersect, a right angle, ${\angle ABC}$,
is formed, since perpendicular lines form right angles. Thus, it follows
that there is a right triangle ${\triangle ABC,}$ since the resulting
triangle from ${\angle ABC}$ forms a right triangle.

Now, consider the distance between the origin, ${B(0,0)}$, and the point
${A(1,m_1)}$. From the distance formula, the length of
${\overline{\rm BA}}$ (the distance between $B$ and $A$) is
${\overline{\rm BA} = \sqrt{1 + {m_1}^2}.}$ Similarly,
${\overline{\rm BC} = \sqrt{1 + {m_2}^2}.}$ Thus,
${\overline{\rm AC} = \sqrt{(1-1)^2 + (m_1-m_2)^2} = m_1 - m_2.}$

From this analysis, we now know all of the lengths of the sides of
${\triangle ABC}$:

1. ${\overline{\rm BA} = \sqrt{1+{m_1}^2}}$
2. ${\overline{\rm BC} = \sqrt{1+{m_2}^2}}$
3. ${\overline{\rm AC} = m_1 - m_2}$

Because we know the lengths for all of the sides of ${\triangle ABC,}$ we
can express ${\triangle ABC}$ as an equation with the Pythagorean Theorem:

$$
	(\sqrt{1+{m_1}^2})^2 + (\sqrt{1+{m_2}^2})^2 = (m_1 - m_2)^2
$$

With this form, we can isolate ${m_1}$ and ${m_2}$ to separate sides of the
equation:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		1 + {m_1}^2 + 1 + {m_2}^2 &= (m_1 - m_2)^2 \\
		2 + {m_1}^2 + {m_2}^2 &= {m_1}^2 - 2{m_1}{m_2} + {m_2}^2 \\
		2 &= -2{m_1}{m_2} \\
		-1 &= {m_1}{m_2} \\
		m_1 &= - \dfrac{1}{m_2} \\
	\end{aligned}
$$

The analysis above applies regardless of where the point of intersection
is, since perpendicular lines will always form right triangles.
Accordingly, it follows that given a line ${\ell_1}$ with the slope ${m_1}$
and a line ${\ell_2}$ with the slope ${m_2}$, for ${\ell_1 \perp \ell_2}$
to be true, it must be the case that ${m_1 = - \dfrac{1}{m_2}}$.
