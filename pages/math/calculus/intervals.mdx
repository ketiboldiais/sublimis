# Invervals

An **interval** $I$ is a special kind of set. It is a subset of
${\mathbb{R}}$ with the property: If ${s \in I,}$ ${t \in I,}$ and
${s < x < t,}$ then ${x \in I.}$ In other words, an interval is simply a
set of real numbers with two explicit members, called **endpoints**, with
the added property that every number between the two endpoints is also an
element of the set. Because there are infinitely many real numbers between
two different real numbers, intervals with distinct endpoints have
infinitely many members.

Intervals can be restricted to include or exclude its endpoints. If the
interval excludes its endpoints, we say that the interval is an **open
interval**. If the interval includes its endpoints, we say that the
interval is an **open interval**.

Because of the special place intervals have in continuous mathematics, they
have two different forms of notation: interval notation, and set notation.
The table below lists some common intervals in both interval and set
notation.

| Interval Notation        | Set Notation                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| ${[a, b]}$               | ${\{x \in \mathbb{R} : a \leq x \leq b\}}$ |
| ${(a,b)}$                | ${\{x \in \mathbb{R} : a < x < b\}}$       |
| ${[a, b)}$               | ${\{ x \in \mathbb{R} : a \leq x < b \}}$  |
| ${(a, b]}$               | ${\{ x \in \mathbb{R} : a < x \leq b \}}$  |
| ${(a, + \infty)}$        | ${\{ x \in \mathbb{R} : x > a \}}$         |
| ${[a, + \infty)}$        | ${\{ x \in \mathbb{R} : x \geq a \}}$      |
| ${(- \infty, b)}$        | ${\{ x \in \mathbb{R} : x < b \}}$         |
| ${(- \infty, b]}$        | ${\{ x \in \mathbb{R} : x \leq b \}}$      |
| ${(- \infty, + \infty)}$ | ${\mathbb{R}}$                             |

To graphically indicate that an interval includes its endpoints, we color
in the the dot marking the endpoint. To indicate exclusion, we leave the
mark unfilled.

Suppose the interval ${(a, b) \in \mathbb{R}^2,}$ and ${a < b.}$ Now
suppose there is a number ${\lambda \in [0,1].}$ Since ${a < b}$, we can
infer ${a - b < 0.}$ We know that
${\lambda{a} + (1 - \lambda){b} = b + \lambda{(a-b)}}$ (simplifying this
expression will yield ${0 = 0}$.) Since ${a - b < 0,}$ we can solve for
$b$: ${b = b + 0(a - b) \leq b + 1(a - b) = a.}$

Now suppose there is a number ${x \in [a,b],}$ and that
${x = \lambda{a} + (1 - \lambda){b}.}$ Solving for ${\lambda,}$ we obtain
${\lambda = \dfrac{x - b}{b - a}.}$ Given that ${0 \leq x - b \leq b - a,}$
it is evident that ${0 \leq \lambda \leq 1.}$

Thus, we can infer the following rule:

> _Lemma_. Given the open interval ${(a,b) \in \mathbb{R^2}}$ and
> ${a < b,}$ every number of the form ${\lambda{a} + (1 - \lambda)b,}$ >
> ${\lambda \in [0,1]}$ belongs to the interval ${[a,b].}$ Conversely, if
> ${x \in [a,b],}$ then we can find a ${\lambda \in [0,1]}$ such that
> ${x = \lambda{a} + (1 - \lambda){b}.}$

## Neighborhoods

Suppose ${a \in \mathbb{R}.}$ The set $\mathcal{N}_a$ is a **neighborhood**
of $a$ if: There exists an open inteval $I$ centered at $a$ such that
${I \subseteq \mathcal{N}_a.}$ I.e., $\mathcal{N} _a$ is a neighborhood of
$a$ if there exists a ${\delta > 0}$ such that the open interval
${(a - \delta, a + \delta) \subseteq \mathcal{N}_a.}$

If $\mathcal{N}_a$ is a neighborhood of $a$, then the notation
${\mathcal{N}_a \setminus \{ a \}}$ signifies the **deleted neighborhood**
of $a$. This implies that ${\mathcal{N}_a}$ is a neighborhood of $a$ if $a$
has neighbors left and right.

For example, consider the following intervals:

	geo={[
		{ type: "line", start: [-10, 5], end: [10, 5] },
		{ type: "line", start: [-5, 5], end: [5, 5], class: 'red'},
		{ type: "line", start: [-10, 3], end: [10, 3] },
		{ type: "line", start: [0, 3], end: [5, 3], class: 'red'},

		{ type: "line", start: [-5, 1], end: [0, 1], class: 'red'},
		{ type: "point", xy: [-5, 5] },
		{ type: "point", xy: [5, 5] },
		{ type: "point", xy: [5, 3] },
		{ type: "point", xy: [-5, 1] },
		{ type: "point", xy: [0, 3] },
		{ type: "point", xy: [0, 5] },
		{ type: "point", xy: [0, 1] },

		{ type: "label", id: "a", xy: [0.25, 4.3],fontSize:0.8},

The first interval demarcates the neighborhood of $a$. The second
interval demarcates the _sinistral neighborhood_ of $a$. Finally, the
third interval demarcates the _dextral neighborhood_ of $a$.

More formally:

> _Lemma_. Let ${a \in \mathbb{R}.}$ The set ${V \subseteq \mathbb{R}}$ is
> a **dextral neighborhood** (right-hand) of $a$ if there exists a
> ${\delta > 0}$ such that ${[a, a + \delta) \subseteq V.}$ The set
> ${V' \subseteq \mathbb{R}}$ is a **sinistral neighborhood** (left-hand)
> of $a$ if there exists a ${\delta' > 0}$ such that
> ${(a - \delta', a] \subseteq V'.}$

In sum, neighborhoods are open intervals centered at a particular real
number $a.$ They can be large or small. The intervals ${(-1000, 1000)}$,
${(-0.00001, 0.00001)}$, and ${(-\pi, \pi)}$ are all neighborhoods of the
real number 0. Moreover, we can restrict our discussion to certain sections
of the neighborhood: the sinistral (left-hand) and dextral (right-hand)
neighborhoods. For example, the interval ${(-100, 0]}$ is the sinistral
neighborhood of 0, and the interval ${[0, 100)}$ is the dextral
neighborhood of 0.

A neighborhood is free to include or exclude its _reference point_. Thus,
where ${a \in \mathbb{R},}$ the ${\delta \text{-neighborhood} }$ of $a$ is
defined as
${U_{\delta}(a) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : \lvert x - a \rvert < \delta \}.}$
This particular set is simply called the neighborhood of $a$, and the
variable ${U_{\delta}(a)}$ is equivalent to ${\mathcal{N}_a}$. If, however,
we were to exclude the reference point $a$, then we obtain what is called a
**reduced neighborhood**&mdash;the set
${P_{\delta}(a) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < \lvert x - a \rvert < \delta \}.}$

Thus, the difference between a _neighborhood of $a$_ and a _reduced
neighborhood of $a$_ is that the reduced neighborhood of $a$ excludes the
reference point $a$, whereas the neighborhood of $a$ includes $a$.
