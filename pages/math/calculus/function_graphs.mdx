# Function Graphs

A function with a domain and range of real numbers can be graphed. When
graphing functions, we use two axes—a horizontal axis for the function's
domain (i.e., inputs) and vertical axis for function's range (i.e.,
outputs). We call the input axis the ${\text{x-axis}}$ and the output axis
the ${\text{y-axis.}}$

> Definition. Given a function ${f,}$ the graph of ${f}$ on the ${x-y}$
> plane consists of those points ${(x, y)}$ such that ${x}$ is the domain
> of ${f}$ and ${y = f(x).}$

## The Vertical Line Test

The vertical line test allows us to determine if a particular graph
represents a function. This is a particularly helpful result when we aren't
provided any equation for a possible function, or if we are uncertain about
what sets the function maps to and from.

> A graph in the ${x-y}$ plane represents a function of $x$ iff any
> vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point.

For example, the graph below is not a function, since the blue vertical
line passes through the plot at more than one point:

<Plot
	functions={[
		{ f: (x) => Math.sqrt(x), color: "var(--red)" },
		{ f: (x) => -Math.sqrt(x), color: "var(--red)" },
		{ f: 5, color: "var(--red)", color: "var(--blue)", dash: 6 },
	]}

## Graphing Transformations

Graphs of functions serve as a bridge between geometry and algebra.
Crossing from geometry to algebra are the definitions of _reflection_,
_translation_, and _scaling_. All of these defines are broadly referred to
as **transformations**—if we reflect, translate, or scale a function's
graph, we are _transforming_ the function's graph.

### Vertical Translation

When we vertically translate a graph, we either shift the graph up or down
the y-axis. For example, the following are vertical translations of the
graph ${f(x) = x^2.}$

<Plot
	functions={[
		{ f: (x) => x ** 2, color: "var(--red)" },
		{ f: (x) => x ** 2 + 1, color: "var(--blue)" },
		{ f: (x) => x ** 2 + 2, color: "var(--green)" },
	]}
	geo={[
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = x^2",
			xy: [2, 0.8],
			w: 60,
			fill: "var(--red)",
		},
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = x^2 + 1",
			xy: [2, 1.8],
			w: 60,
			fill: "var(--blue)",
		},
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = x^2 + 2",
			xy: [2, 2.8],
			w: 60,
			fill: "var(--green)",
		},
	]}
	domain={[-5, 5]}
	range={[-5, 5]}
	id="vertical_translation"
/>

Observe that when add a positive constant to the function's expression, we
shift the graph up the $y$-axis. And when we add a negative constant (i.e.,
subtraction) to the function's expression, we shift the grown down the
$y$-axis. This logically follows from the fact that we are essentially
adding a constant value to each element in the function's _range_. In other
words, for every output, add or substract some constant—shift the graph up
or down respectively.

> which shifts ${G(f)}$ by ${c}$ units _down_ the $y$-axis.
>
> If ${c = 0,}$ then there is no transformation, and _a fortiori_, no
> vertical translation.

### Horizontal Translation

When we _horizontally translate_ a graph, we either shift the graph left or
right along the $x$-axis. In essence, we are are adding or subtracting some
constant from each element in the function's _domain_: For every input, add
or substract some constant value. Horizontal translations, however, are a
common source of error.

Consider again the graph of ${y = x^2.}$ To shift the graph to the right,
we add some negative constant ${c}$ to every input. Thus, ${y = (x - c)^2}$
indicates a shift ${c}$ units to the right along the $x$-axis. Why is it a
shift right? Because to get back to the original function ${y}$, we have to
add ${c}$ units. It is the same logic behind why scrolling down with a
mouse wheel moves this page up, or why a gear moving clockwise turns a
second gear counter-clockwise. For example, given ${y = x^2,}$ the
parabola's vertex is ${(0,0).}$ However, given ${y = (x-1)^2,}$ the
parabola's vertex is now ${(1,0);}$ a shift to the right.

In contrast, given ${y = (x + c)^2,}$ we have a horizontal shift to the
_left_. Again, consider ${y = x^2.}$ The parabola is ${(0, 0).}$ When
${y = (x + 1)^2,}$ the vertex is now ${(-1, 0);}$ a shift to the left.
Below are horizontal translations:

<Plot
	functions={[
		{ f: (x) => x ** 2, color: "var(--red)" },
		{ f: (x) => (x - 1) ** 2, color: "var(--blue)" },
		{ f: (x) => (x + 1) ** 2, color: "var(--green)" },
	]}
	geo={[
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = x^2",
			xy: [3.5, 0.8],
			w: 70,
			fill: "var(--red)",
		},
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = (x-1)^2",
			xy: [3.5, 1.8],
			w: 70,
			fill: "var(--blue)",
		},
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = (x+1)^2",
			xy: [3.5, 2.8],
			w: 70,
			fill: "var(--green)",
		},
	]}

In sum: If we subtract a constant, we shift right; add a constant, we shift
left.
