# The Cartesian Plane

Continuous mathematics depends heavily on graphs. One way to represent
graphs is through the Cartesian plane:

<Plot geo={[
	{type:'label', xy: [4,5], id: '\\R^+ \\times \\R^+', fontSize:0.9,w:60},
	{type:'label', xy: [-7,5], id: '\\R^- \\times \\R^+', fontSize:0.9,w:60},
	{type:'label', xy: [-7,-4], id: '\\R^- \\times \\R^-', fontSize:0.9,w:60},
	{type:'label', xy: [4,-4], id: '\\R^+ \\times \\R^-', fontSize:0.9,w:60},
]}/>

The Cartesian plane consists of two perpendicular real number lines. The
point where the lines intersect is 0, and is called the **origin**. The
horizontal number line is usually called the x-axis, and the vertical
number line the $y$-axis. On the $x$-axis, all points to the right of
the origin represent the positive real numbers, and all points to the left
of the origin represent the negative real numbers. On the $y$-axis, all
points above the origin reprepresent the positive real numbers, and all
points below the origin represent the negative real numbers.

A point on the Cartesian plane is represented by an **ordered pair**, of
the form ${ x, y }$, where ${ x }$ is a point on the $x$-axis, and ${ y }$
is a point on the $y$-axis. For example:

<Plot geo={[
	{type: 'point', xy: [2,2]},
	{type: 'label', xy: [2,2],id:'(2,2)'},
	{type: 'point', xy: [3,5]},
	{type: 'label', xy: [3,5],id:'(3,5)'},
	{type: 'point', xy: [-7,4]},
	{type: 'label', xy: [-7,4],id:'(-7,4)'},
	{type: 'point', xy: [-8,1]},
	{type: 'label', xy: [-8,1],id:'(-8,1)'},
	{type: 'point', xy: [-4,-4]},
	{type: 'label', xy: [-4,-4],id:'(-4,-4)'},
	{type: 'point', xy: [2,-8]},
	{type: 'label', xy: [2,-8],id:'(2,-8)'},
	{type: 'point', xy: [8,-3]},
	{type: 'label', xy: [8,-3],id:'(8,-3)'},
]}

Each of the points in the diagram above are **Cartesian coordinates**, or
simply _coordinates_. The $x$-coordinate is formally called the
**abscissa** of the point, and the $y$-coordinate the **ordinate**. When we
refer to coordinates generally, or in the abstract, we write:

$$
	P(x,y)
$$

The notation above is read "the point ${ (x,y) }$."
