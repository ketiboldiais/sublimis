# Functions

Functions. What are they? At the most basic level, a function is a rule
assigning a number to another number. At a more abstract level, a function
is a _relation_ between mathematical objects. There are many relations in
mathematics (equality, inequality, congruence, proximity, etc.). Functions
are just one kind of relation. Most commonly, functions are relations
between numbers, where one number shares a specific relationship, defined
by a rule, to exactly one number. More explicitly: A function is a rule
that assigns one number to another number. Do not confuse this idea of
"one-to-one" with "one-to-unique." A relation can still be a function even
if one or more numbers are related to the same number.

Functions can be represented in a variety of ways. We can represent
functions algebraically, using an equation or formula: ${f(x) = \ln x,}$
${g = \sqrt{h}}$, or ${F = ma}$. We can represent functions verbally: "For
every $x$, there is a $y$ such that $y$ is $x$ squared." We can represent
functions with tables, where one column lists the values of $x$, and
another lists their corresponding $y$ values. Finally, we can represent
functions with graphs, using a coordinate system. Regardless of the way we
represent them, functions all express the same idea: a relationship where
one mathematical object maps to exactly one mathematical object, according
to a rule.

A more formal definition:

> _Definition_. Let $A$ and $B$ be nonempty sets. A **function** from $A$
> to $B$ is a _rule of correspondence_ that assigns, or maps, to each
> element in $A$ _exactly one_ element in ${B.}$

Consider the following relations:

The relation $u$ maps the elements of $A$ to the elements of ${B.}$ The
relation $v$ maps the elements of $C$ to the elements of ${D.}$ And the
relation $w$ maps the elements of $E$ to the elements of ${F.}$ The
relation $u$ is a function, since it maps each element of $A$ to exactly
one element of $B.$ The same goes for relation $v$ &mdash; each element of
$C$ is mapped to exactly one element of ${D,}$ even if some elements of $C$
map to the same element of ${D.}$ The relation ${w,}$ however, is _not_ a
function, since at least one element of $E$ is mapped to more than one
element of ${F.}$

We often refer to the inputs of a function with the variable $x$, and the
outputs of the function with the variable $y$, or $f(x)$. The input, $x$,
is also called the _independent variable_, and the output, $f(x)$, is
called the _dependent_ variable.

A function will never give more than one output for one input. There are,
of course, relationships where on number outputs more than one number.
Those relationships, however, are not characterized by, or as, functions.
We will explore those relationships later in due time.

> _Definition_ Given two sets $A$ and $B$, the set Cartesian product
> $A \times B$ the set of all ordered pairs $(a,b)$, where $a \in A$ and
> $b \in B$. A subset of $A \times B$ is called a **relation**.

A **function** is a special kind of relation. It is a pairing of elements
in $A$ with elements in $B$, where each eleemnt in $A$ is paired with
exactly one element in $B$. Thus, a function $f$ from $A$ to $B$ is a rule
or relation between $A$ and $B$ that _assigns_, or _maps_, each element
$a \in A$ to _one_ element in $b \in B$.

If a function is a subset of $A \times B$, then $A$ is the **domain** of
the function, and $B$ is the **range** of the function.

Every function has a **natural domain** (also called the _implied domain_).
The natural domain of a function is the set of all elements for which the
function is defined. Whenever we analyze or discuss a function, we set a
natural domain. That natural domain acts as the boundary of our analysis.
For example, when we discuss the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$, we may specify
that the natural domain of $f$ is $\mathbb{R}$. Because the natural domain
of $f$ is $\mathbb{R}$, the domain of $f$ cannot include negative real
numbers, since $\sqrt{x}$ is undefined for $\mathbb{R}^{-}$. Because of
this fact, we specify the domain of $f$ as:

$$
	dom(f) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x \geq 0 \}
$$

## Properties of Functions

Functions can be identified by several properties:

1. A set of inputs, called the function's **domain**, denoted ${dom(f),}$
   e.g., the domain of the function ${f(x) = x^2}$ is
   ${dom(f) = \mathbb{R}.}$

2. A set of all _possible_ inputs, called the function's **natural
   domain**, denoted ${D(f),}$ e.g., the natural domain of the function
   ${c(d) = \sqrt{d}}$ is ${ D(c) = \mathbb{R}}$, but the domain of the
   function is ${dom(d) = \{ d \in \mathbb{R} \mid d \geq 0 \}.}$ In set
   notation, given a function ${f,}$ ${dom(f) \subseteq D(f).}$

3. A set of outputs, called the function's **range**, or **image**, denoted
   ${ran(f)}$ or ${Im(f),}$ e.g., the function ${y(w) = \dfrac{1}{w}}$ has
   the range of ${Im(y) = \mathbb{R}.}$

4. A set of all _possible_ outputs, called the function's **codomain**, or
   **target**, denoted ${\text{target}(f),}$ e.g., the function
   ${h(z) = z + 1}$ has a codomain of ${\text{target}(h) = \mathbb{R},}$
   but if we restricted ${dom(h) = \{ 1,2 \},}$ then ${Im(h) = \{ 2,3 \},}$
   but its codomain remains ${\text{target}(h) = \mathbb{R}.}$ In set
   notation, given a function ${f,}$ ${Im(f) \subseteq \text{target}(f);}$

5. A name for a typical input, called a **dummy variable**, e.g., the
   function ${g(p) = \dfrac{1}{p} }$ has the dummy variable $p$.

6. A name for the function, e.g., the function ${m(j) = \ln j}$ has the
   name ${m(j).}$

7. An assignment rule or formula assigning to every element of the domain
   exactly one element of the **codomain**, e.g., the function
   ${r(t) = t^2 + 4t + 1}$ has the assignment rule ${t^2 + 4t + 1.}$

8. Some functions have graphs, denoted ${G(f).}$ (We say "some" because a
   function need not concern numbers. A relation mapping common fruit names
   to their respective scientific names is just as much a function as
   ${s(t) = \sqrt{t - 1}.)}$

## Arrow Notation

All functions can be represented in arrow notation:

/>

For example, the function ${f(x) = x^2}$, in arrow notation, is
${f: x \mapsto x^2,}$ and its domain and codomain are represented as
${\mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}.}$ The benefit of arrow notation is that it
allows us to easily restrict a function's inputs and outputs, which in turn
allows us to differentiate functions explicitly. This is a particularly
useful asset when the functions share the same assignment rule:

Suppose the function ${f(x) = x^3 + 3x + 4.}$ The functions below all have
the same assignment rule as ${f,}$ but they are all different functions:

- ${f: x \mapsto x^3 + 3x + 4;}$ ${f: \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}.}$
- ${g: x \mapsto x^3 + 3x + 4;}$ ${g: \mathbb{R} \mapsto [0, + \infty).}$
- ${h: x \mapsto x^3 + 3x + 4;}$ ${h: [0, + \infty) \mapsto \mathbb{R}.}$
- ${i: x \mapsto x^3 + 3x + 4;}$
  ${i: [0, + \infty) \mapsto [0, + \infty).}$

The function $f$ is neither injective nor surjective, the function $b$ is
injective but not surjective, the function $c$ is surjective but not
injective, and the function $d$ is a bijection.

Note that in the last function, the function name $i$ was used. This is
generally considered poor writing in mathematics, as the letter $i$ is
almost always exclusively reserved for the imaginary number $i$ (setting
aside the unorthodox practices of electrical engineers using $j$).
