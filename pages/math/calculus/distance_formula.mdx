# The Distance Formula

The Cartesian plane constructs a bridge between algebra and geometry. Many
theorems and ideas from geometry can be applied in continuous mathematics.
One such theorem is the Pythagorean theorem:

> _Theorem_. Given a right trangle, the lengths of the sides are related by
> the equation: ${a^2 + b^2 = c^2,}$ where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are the lengths
> of the sides forming the right triangle, and ${c}$ is the length of the
> hypotentuse.

Conversely, if ${a,}$ ${b,}$ and ${c}$ are the sides of a triangle, and all
three lengths are related by an equation of the form ${a^2 + b^2 = c^2,}$
then the triangle is a right triangle, and ${c}$ is the hypotenuse.

We can visualize the Pythagorean Theorem with the following diagram:

The Pythagorean Theorem leads directly to the **Distance Formula**, an
equation that allows us to compute the distance between two points on the
Cartesian plane:

> Formula. Given two points ${ P_1(x_1, y_1) }$ and ${ P_2(x_2, y_2) }$,
> the distance $d$ between ${ P_1 }$ and ${ P_2 }$ is given by the formula:
>
> $$
> \begin{aligned}
> 	d^2 &= {\lvert x_2 - x_1 \rvert}^2 + { \lvert y_2 - y_1 \rvert }^2 \\
> 	d &= \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
> \end{aligned}
