Consider the following statement: &#8220;Farmer's beware: The coyote
population is set to increase at a rate of 434 coyotes each year.&#8221;
News outlets often erroneously describe this as &#8220;exponential
increase.&#8221; _Exponential growth_, however, has a very specific
meaning, and it relates to _exponential functions_. We define them now to
rid ourselves of blatantly false and misleading information:

1. The term _percentage change_ refers to a _change_ based on a _percent_
   of the _initial value_.

2. The term _exponential increase_ refers to an _increase_ based on a
   _constant multiplicative rate of change_ over _equal increments of time_
   &mdash; i.e., a _percent_ increase of the initial value over equal time
   intervals.

3. The term _exponential decrease_ refers to a _decrease_ based on a
   _constant multiplicative rate of change_ over _equal increments of time_
   &mdash; i.e., a _percent_ decrease of the initial value over equal time
   intervals.

Thus, whenever we use the phrase _exponential increase_, we are referring
to a _rule of assignment_ &mdash; a function definition. When say,
&#8220;$x$ grows exponentially,&#8221; mean that ${f(x_0)}$ increases by
_the same percentage_ over equal incrementing intervals ${I}$ in
${\text{dom}(f).}$ What many refer to as &#8220;exponential growth&#8221;
is actually _linear growth_ &mdash; ${f(x_0)}$ increases by a _constant_
over equal incrementing intervals ${I}$ in ${\text{dom}(f).}$

> Definition. For any ${x \in \R,}$ an exponential function is a function
> of the form ${f(x) = ab^x.}$ Where:
>
> - ${a \in \R^*}$ (${\R^* = \R \setminus \{ 0 \}}$)
> - ${b \in \R^{+}}$

The domain of ${f}$ is the set of all real numbers ${\R.}$ If ${a > 0,}$
then ${\text{ran}(f) \in \R^{+}.}$ If ${a < 0,}$ then
${\text{ran}(f) \in \R^{-}.}$ Further:
${\text{y-intercept}(f) \coloneqq (0, a).}$ And
${\text{[horizontal asymptote]}(f) \coloneqq (y=0).}$

## Exponential Increase

_Exponential increase functions_ are a subset of exponential functions.
Accordingly, exponential growth functions inherit all of the properties and
parameters of exponential functions, but narrow and override them in
certain aspects:

> Definition. For every ${x \in \R,}$ ${\{a, b \in \R\ \mid b \neq 1\},}$
> the exponential increase function has the form: ${f(x) = ab^x.}$
>
> - ${x \in \R,}$
> - ${a, b \in \R,}$ and
> - ${b > 1.}$

The variable ${a}$ is called the _initial value_ of ${f,}$ ${x}$ the
_growth factor_ of ${f}$ (measured per unit of ${x}$), and ${b}$ the
_constant ratio_ of ${f.}$

In an exponential increase function, the function's output values grow by a
rate proportional to the input value passed into the function. This
behavior is inherited from the general case of exponential functions. In an
exponential function, the function's outputs depend entirely on the base,
and the base is a _constant_. That constant is then raised to a _variable_
exponent. For example, suppose ${f(x) = 2^x.}$ Then, we have:

| ${x}$      | ${f}$              | ${f(x)}$   |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| ${x = -3}$ | ${f(-3) = 2^{-3}}$ | ${1/8}$    |
| ${x = -2}$ | ${f(-2) = 2^{-2}}$ | ${1/4}$    |
| ${x = -1}$ | ${f(-1) = 2^{-1}}$ | ${1/2}$    |
| ${x = 0}$  | ${f(0) = 2^0}$     | ${1}$      |
| ${x = 1}$  | ${f(1) = 2^1}$     | ${2}$      |
| ${x = 2}$  | ${f(2) = 2^2}$     | ${4}$      |
| ${x = 3}$  | ${f(3) = 2^3}$     | ${8}$      |
| ${x = 4}$  | ${f(4) = 2^4}$     | ${16}$     |
| ${x = 5}$  | ${f(5) = 2^5}$     | ${32}$     |
| ${\vdots}$ | ${\vdots}$         | ${\vdots}$ |

As a graph:

Notice the key point at ${(0,1).}$

## Finding Equations of Exponential Increase Functions

Often, we are given a set of information that must be represented as an
exponential model. Below is an algorithm for constructing exponential
models from existing data.

Given two data points, to construct an exponential model:

1. If one of the data points has the form ${(0,a)}$ then ${a}$ is the base
   case (the initial value).
2. Using ${a,}$ substitute the second point into the equation
   ${f(x) = a(b)^x,}$ and solve for ${b.}$
3. If neither of the data points have the form ${(0,a),}$ substitute both
   points into two equations with the form ${f(x) = a(b)^x,}$ and solve the
   resulting system of two equations in two variables to find ${a}$ and
   ${b.}$
4. Using the ${a}$ and ${b}$ found in the steps above, write the
   exponential function in the form ${f(x) = a(b)^x.}$

For example, suppose we have two data points, ${(0,80)}$ and ${(6, 180)}$
To construct the exponential model.

We have ${(0,80),}$ so we solve for ${b:}$

$$
	f(x) = 80(b)^x
$$

Substituting with ${(6, 180):}$

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		180 &= 80(b)^6 \\
		180/80 &= b^6 \\
		9/4 &= b^6 \\
		(9/4)^{1/6} &= b \\
		\sqrt[6]{9/4} &= b \\
		b &= \dfrac{\sqrt[6]{9}}{\sqrt[6]{4}} \approx 1.1447 \\
	\end{aligned}
$$

Using ${a}$ and ${b}$ to write ${f(x) = a(b)^x,}$ we have the following
model:

$$
	f(x) = 80(1.1447)^x
$$

Another example, without the base case: Suppose we have the points
${(-2, 6)}$ and ${(2,1).}$

Substituting ${(-2,6)}$ returns ${6 = ab^{-2}.}$ Substituting ${(2,1)}$
returns ${1 = ab^{2}.}$ Solving the system of equations, we first solve for
${a}$ in terms of ${b:}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
	6 &= ab^{-2} \\
	\dfrac{6}{b^{-2}} &= a \\
	6b^2 &= a
\end{aligned}
$$

Solving for ${b}$ in terms of ${a:}$

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		1 = ab^2 \\
		1 = (6b^2)b^2 = 6b^4 \\
		1/6 = b^4 \\
		(1/6)^{1/4} = b \\
		b \approx 0.6389
	\end{aligned}
$$

Using the value of ${b}$ to solve for the value of ${a:}$

$$
	a = 6b^2 \approx 6(0.6389)^2 \approx 2.4492
$$

Using ${a}$ and ${b}$ to write the equation ${f(x) = ab^x,}$ we have the
model:

$$
	f(x) = (2.4492)(0.6389)^x
$$

As we can see, models are not perfectly accurate. Inaccuracy is inevitable,
however, because the models are likely analyzed and generated by computers.
Computers themselves cannot generate an infinite amount of decimal places.
But, inevitable inaccuracy does not imply we cannot reduce margins of
error. One way to reduce error margins is to delay rounding as long as we
can until the very end of the process. Never round intermediate
calculations unless there are truly no other options.

Exponential Decrease Functions. Like the exponential increase function,
_exponential decrease functions_ are a subset of exponential functions.

> Definition. The exponential increase function has the form:
>
> $$
> 	m(x) = ab^x
> $$
>
> where ${x \in \R,}$ ${a, b \in \R,}$ and ${b < 1.}$

The variable ${a}$ is called the _initial value_ of ${m,}$ ${x}$ the
_growth factor_ of ${f}$ (measured per unit of ${x}$), and ${b}$ the
_constant ratio_ of ${m.}$ The same algorithms discussed above apply to
exponential decrease functions.

## Euler's Number

The general form of the compound interest formula is given by the
following:

$$
	A(t) = P\left(1 + \dfrac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
$$

Where ${A(t)}$ is the account value; ${t}$ is the number of years ${P}$ is
initial amount of the account (the principal) ${r}$ is the annual
percentage rate, expressed as a float ${n}$ is the number of compounding
periods in one year.

The compound interest formula tells us that the account's initial amount
increases as the compound frequency increases. Suppose ${P = 1}$ and
${t = 1.}$ Then suppose that the amount is compounded from annually, to
semiannually, to quarterly, to monthly, to daily, etc. From these
assumptions, we have the following table:

| Frequency    | ${A(t) = \left(1 + \dfrac{1}{n}\right)^{nt}}$                    | Value    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| annually     | ${A(t) = \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{1} \right)^1}$                     | 2        |
| semiannually | ${A(t) = \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{2} \right)^2}$                     | 2.25     |
| quarterly    | ${A(t) = \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{4} \right)^4}$                     | 2.441406 |
| monthly      | ${A(t) = \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{12} \right)^{12}}$                 | 2.613035 |
| daily        | ${A(t) = \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{365} \right)^{365}}$               | 2.714567 |
| hourly       | ${A(t) = \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{8,760} \right)^{8,760}}$           | 2.718279 |
| per minute   | ${A(t) = \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{525,600} \right)^{525,600}}$       | 2.71829  |
| per second   | ${A(t) = \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{31,536,000} \right)^{31,536,000}}$ | 2.718282 |

This is interesting. It appears that the value eventually converge at
approximately 2.718. Indeed, it does (we will see a proof in later
sections). We provide a formal definition now:

> Definition. The irrational number of the form:
> ${e = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \dfrac{1}{n}\right)^n}$ is
> represented by **Euler's constant** ${e,}$ whose approximate value is
> ${2.718282.}$

The number ${e}$ holds a special place in both pure and applied
mathematics, and we will see it frequently. ${e}$ is especially important
for _continuous growth functions_ and _continuous decay functions_.

## Continuous Growth Functions

_Continuous growth functions_ are a subset of _exponential increase
functions_. Continuous growth functions are pervasive in computer science,
physics, chemistry, and biology. In finance, we see continuous growth
functions in the form of continuous compounding.

> Definition. The **continuous growth function** ${G}$ is a function of the
> form ${G(t) = ve^{gt}}$ where ${t \in \R,}$ ${v, g \in \R^{+},}$ >
> ${g > 0,}$ and ${e}$ is Euler's constant. ${v}$ is called the initial
> value of ${G,}$ ${g}$ the _continuous growth rate_ (per unit of time
> elapsed, ${t.}$)

A common example of the continous growth function is ${f(x) = e^x,}$ where
${e}$ is [Euler's number](#eulers-number) (roughly 2.718, visualized below
as the dashed blue line):

		{ f: (x) => Math.E ** x, color: "var(--red)" },
		{ f: Math.E, color: "var(--blue)", dash: 4 },
	]}
	id={"exponential_growth_1"}
/>

## Continuous Decay Functions

_Continuous decay functions_ are a subset of _exponential decrease
functions_. A common use case for continous decay functions is carbon
dating, where a particular carbon-based object's age is measured according
to the half-life of ${^{14}C,}$ a radioactive carbon isotope.

> Definition. The **continuous decay function** is a function of the form:
> ${D(t) = ve^{dt}}$ where ${t \in \R,}$ ${v, r \in \R^{+},}$ ${r < 0,}$
> and ${e}$ is Euler's constant ${v}$ is called the initial value of
> ${G,}$ > ${g}$ the _continuous decay rate_ (per unit of time elapsed,
> ${t.}$)

A simple continuous decay function is ${f(x) = (1/2)^x:}$

<Plot
	functions={[{ f: (x) => 0.5 ** x, color: "var(--red)" }]}
	id={"exponential_decay_1"}
/>

Note that from the laws of exponents, ${f(x) = (1/2)^x}$ is equivalent to
${f(x) = 2^{-x}.}$ Given a continuous growth or continuous decay function
${f(t),}$ we can compute the output of ${f(t)}$ at some input value ${t}$
with the following algorithm.

Let ${f(t)}$ be a continuous growth or continous decay function. To compute
the output of ${f(t)}$ at some input value ${t,}$

1. Use the problem's information to determine ${v,}$ the initial value of
   the ${f.}$
2. Use the problem's information to determine the rate ${r}$ of ${f.}$
3. If the problem refers to _continuous growth_, then ${r > 0}$ (i.e.,
   ${r \in \R^{+};}$ ${r}$ is a positive real number).
4. If the problem refers to _continuous decay_, then ${r < 0}$ (i.e.,
   ${r \in \R^{-};}$ ${r}$ is a negative real number).
5. Use the problem's information to determine the time ${t.}$
6. Substitute the given information into the continous growth formula and
   solve for ${f(t).}$

## Graphs of Exponential Functions

Exponential functions have generally the same graph. The most obvious
difference is that exponential decrease functions decrease, and exponential
increase functions increase:

<Grid cols={2}>

<Plot
	functions={[{ f: (x) => 2 ** x, color: "var(--red)" }]}
	geo={[
		{ type: "label", id: "f(x) = 2^x", xy: [3, 3], w: 100, fontSize: 0.9 },
	]}
	id={"increase1"}
/>

<Plot
	functions={[{ f: (x) => 2 ** -x, color: "var(--red)" }]}
	geo={[
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = 2^{-x}",
			xy: [3, 3],
			w: 100,
			fontSize: 0.9,
		},
	]}
	id={"increase2"}
/>

</Grid>

In both functions above the _constant ratio_, or the base, is 2. Where they
differ is how the inputs and outputs relate.

For the _exponential increase function_ we have the following observations:
(1) The output value is always positive or 0. (2) As the input values
increase, the output values also increase. (3) Large input values return
large ouput values, and small input values return small output values. More
formally:

> Properties. Given an exponential increase function with the form
> ${f(x) = b^x,}$ the following properties hold:
>
> 1. ${b > 1.}$
> 2. ${f}$ is an injective (one-to-one) function.
> 3. ${f}$ is an increasing function.
> 4. ${\lim\limits_{x \to + \infty} f(x) = + \infty}$
> 5. ${\lim\limits_{x \to - \infty} f(x) = 0}$
> 6. ${f}$ has the horizontal asymptote ${y = 0.}$
> 7. ${f}$ has no vertical asymptote.
> 8. ${\text{dom}(f) = (- \infty , \infty ) = \{ x \}.}$
> 9. ${\text{ran}(f) = (0, \infty) = \{ x \in \R_{\geq 0} \}.}$
> 10. ${f}$ has no ${\text{x-intercept}.}$
> 11. ${f}$ has the ${\text{y-intercept}}$ ${(0,1).}$

For the _exponential decrease function_, we observe: (1) The output value
is always positive or 0. (2) As the input values increase, the output
values decrease. (3) Large input values return small output values, and
small input values return large output values. More formally:

> Properties. Given an exponential decrease function with the form
> ${f(x) = b^x,}$ the following properties hold:
>
> 1. ${b < 1.}$
> 2. ${f}$ is an injective (one-to-one) function.
> 3. ${f}$ is a decreasing function.
> 4. ${\lim\limits_{x \to + \infty} f(x) = 0}$
> 5. ${\lim\limits_{x \to - \infty} f(x) = + \infty}$
> 6. ${f}$ has the horizontal asymptote ${y = 0.}$
> 7. ${f}$ has no vertical asymptote.
> 8. ${\text{dom}(f) = (- \infty , \infty ) = \{ x \}.}$
> 9. ${\text{ran}(f) = (0, \infty) = \{ x \in \R_{\geq 0} \}.}$
> 10. ${f}$ has no ${\text{x-intercept}.}$
> 11. ${f}$ has the ${\text{y-intercept}}$ ${(0,1).}$

Exponential Function Base Case. An important point regarding exponential
functions: With an exponential function of the form ${f(x) = b^x,}$ where
${b}$ is a constant, the base case is ${b = 0.}$ Because a base case
exists, we can write recursive programs employing exponentials.

## Transformations of Exponential Functions

We can transform exponential function graphs just as we would other
functions. Suppose the exponential function ${f(x) = b^{x}.}$

### Vertical Shifts

A _vertical shift_ occurs if ${f(x) = b^x + C,}$ where ${C}$ is a constant.
If ${C \in \R^{+},}$ then ${G(f)}$ shifts _up_ the ${y \text{-axis}}$ by
${C}$ units. If ${C \in \R^{-},}$ then ${G(f)}$ shifts _down_ the
${y \text{-axis}}$ by ${C}$ units.

<Plot
	functions={[
		{ f: (x) => 2 ** x, color: "var(--red)" },
		{ f: (x) => 2 ** x + 1, color: "var(--blue)" },
		{ f: (x) => 2 ** x - 1, color: "var(--green)" },
	]}
	geo={[
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = 2^x + 1",
			fill: "var(--blue)",
			w: 100,
			xy: [4, 5],
		},
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = 2^x",
			fill: "var(--red)",
			w: 100,
			xy: [4, 3],
		},
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = 2^x - 1",
			fill: "var(--green)",
			w: 100,
			xy: [4, 1],
		},
	]}
	id={"exponential_v_shift"}
/>

Note that when we vertically shift the graph, ${f}$'s vertical asymptote
changes. When ${f(x) = 2^x + 1,}$ the vertical asymptote is ${y = 1.}$ When
${f(x) = 2^x - 1,}$ the vertical asymptote is ${y = -1.}$

If ${f(x) = 2^x + C,}$ we shift ${f(x) = 2^x}$ _up_ the y-axis, we observe
the following: (i) ${\text{dom}(f) = \{ x \in \R \};}$ i.e., the domain
remains unchanged. (ii) When ${f}$ is shifted up by ${C,}$ the y-intercept
shifts up by ${C}$ units to ${(0, C).}$ Furthermore, the horizontal
asymptote shifts up by ${C}$ units to ${y = C.}$ (iii) The range bcecomes
${\text{ran} = \{ f(x) \in \R \mid f(x) > C \}.}$

If ${f(x) = 2^x - C,}$ we shift ${f(x) = 2^x}$ _down_ the y-axis then: (i)
The y-intercept shifts down ${C}$ units to ${(0, -C).}$ (ii) The asymptote
shifts down ${C}$ units to ${y = -C.}$ (iii) The range becomes
${\text{ran} = \{ f(x) \in \R \mid f(x) > -C \},}$ while the domain remains
unchanged, ${\{ x \in \R \}.}$

### Horizontal Shifts

A horizontal shift occurs when we add a constant ${C}$ to the parent
function's power ${x,}$ in ${f(x) = b^x.}$ This will return a horizontal
shift in the _opposite_ direction of the sign.

<Plot
	functions={[
		{ f: (x) => 2 ** x, color: "var(--red)" },
		{ f: (x) => 2 ** (x + 3), color: "var(--blue)" },
		{ f: (x) => 2 ** (x - 3), color: "var(--green)" },
	]}
	geo={[
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = 2^{x + 3}",
			fill: "var(--blue)",
			w: 100,
			xy: [-8, 8],
		},
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = 2^x",
			fill: "var(--red)",
			w: 100,
			xy: [-8, 6],
		},
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = 2^{x - 3}",
			fill: "var(--green)",
			w: 100,
			xy: [-8, 4],
		},
	]}
	id={"exponential_h_shift"}
/>

Observations from shifting ${f(x) = 2^x}$ horizontally: (1) The domain,
${(- \infty , \infty),}$ ${\R,}$ remains unchanged. (2) The horizontal
asymptote, ${y = 0,}$ remains unchanged. (3) The y-intercept shifts such
that: (i) When the function is shifted _left_ 1 unit &mdash;
${f(x) = 2^{x+1}}$ &mdash; the y-intercept becomes ${(0,2).}$ This is
because ${f(0) = 2^{0+1} = 2^1 = 2.}$ so the initial value of the function
is 2. (ii) When the function is shifted _right_ 1 unit &mdash;
${f(x) = 2^{x-1}}$ &mdash; the y-intercept becomes ${(0, 1/2).}$ Again,
because ${f(0) = 2^{0-1} = 2^{-1} = 1/2.}$

We can can encapsulate the transformations with an algorithm for drawing
them.

Given an exponential function with the form ${g(x) = b^{x + C} + d,}$ the
transformation can be graphed through the following algorithm:

1. Draw the graph of ${f(x) = b^x.}$ Call this graph ${G(f).}$
2. Draw the horizontal asymptote ${y = d.}$
3. Identify the shift as ${(-C, d).}$
4. If ${C \in \R^{+},}$ shift ${G(f)}$ _left_ ${C}$ units.
5. If ${C \in \R^{-},}$ shift ${G(f)}$ _right_ ${C}$ units.
6. If ${d \in \R^{+},}$ shift ${G(f)}$ _up_ ${d}$ units.
7. If ${d \in \R^{-},}$ shift ${G(f)}$ _down_ ${d}$ units.
8. State the domain, ${\R,}$ and the range, ${d, \infty,}$ and the
   horizontal asymptote, ${y = d.}$

## Stretching and Compressing Exponential Function Graphs

When we multiply the parent function ${f(x) = b^x}$ by a constant
${\lvert a \rvert > 1,}$ we _vertically stretch_ (or _horizontally
compress_) ${G(f)}$ by a factor of ${a.}$ When we multiply the parent
function ${f(x) = b^x}$ by a constant ${\lvert a \rvert < 1,}$ we
_vertically compress_ (or _horizontally stretch_) ${G(f)}$ by a factor of
${a.}$ Consider the following:

<Plot
	functions={[
		{ f: (x) => 2 ** x, color: "var(--red)" },
		{ f: (x) => 2 ** (x * 0.5), color: "var(--blue)" },
		{ f: (x) => 2 ** (x * 2), color: "var(--green)" },
	]}
	geo={[
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = 2^{x/2}",
			fill: "var(--blue)",
			w: 100,
			xy: [-8, 8],
		},
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = 2^x",
			fill: "var(--red)",
			w: 100,
			xy: [-8, 6],
		},
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = 2^{2x}",
			fill: "var(--green)",
			w: 100,
			xy: [-8, 4],
		},
	]}
	id={"exponential_stretch"}
/>

We can summarize these properties as such:

> Properties. Let ${f(x) = a(b)^x.}$ For any factor ${a > 0,}$

1. If ${\lvert a \rvert > 1,}$ then ${G(f)}$ is _stretched vertically_ by a
   factor of ${a.}$
2. If ${\lvert a \rvert < 1,}$ then ${G(f)}$ is _compressed vertically_ by
   a factor ${a.}$
3. ${G(f)}$ has a y-intercept of ${(0,a).}$ ${G(f)}$ has a horizontal
   asymptote at ${y = 0.}$
4. The domain and range of the shifted graph are unchanged from the parent
   function:
5. ${\text{dom}(f) = (- \infty , \infty.)}$
6. ${\text{ran}(f) = (0, \infty).}$

## Reflections of Exponential Function Graphs

The last possible transformation is **reflection**. When we multiply the
_outputs_ of the parent function ${f(x) = b^x}$ by ${-1,}$ we reflect
${G(f)}$ along the x-axis. When we multiply the _inputs_ of the parent
function ${f(x) = b^x}$ by ${-1,}$ we reflect ${G(f)}$ along the y-axis.

Summarizing these properties:

> Properties. Suppose ${f(x) = b^x.}$ Then the graph of ${g(x) = -b^x}$
>
> - reflects ${G(f)}$ about the x-axis.
> - has the y-intercept of ${(0,1),}$
> - ${\text{dom}(g) = (- \infty , \infty) = \R,}$
> - ${\text{ran}(g) = (- \infty , 0),}$
> - has a horizontal asymptote at ${y = 0.}$
>
> The graph of ${h(x) = b^{-x}}$
