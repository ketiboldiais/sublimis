# Propositional Logic

Propositional logic provides the foundations of both computer science and
mathematics. The following materials provide a review of the logic
necessary to understanding mathematics.

There are two kinds of mathematical statements: **predicates** and
**propositions**. A proposition is a special kind of mathematical statement
&mdash; it's a statement that can be verified as either true or false. For
example, all of statements below are examples of mathematical statements:

1. ${1 + 2 = 3}$
2. ${x < x + 1}$
3. ${\pi = 3}$

Each of the statements above can be verified as true or false. Mathematical
statements, however, don't have to be written with symbols. In fact, much
of formal mathematics is written in prose:

> Every even integer greater than ${2}$ can be written as the sum of two
> prime numbers.

The statement above is a famous mathematical statement called the _Goldbach
Conjecture_.

A **predicate** is an "incomplete" mathematical statement. By "incomplete"
we mean a statement that cannot be verified as true or false unless we add
further specification. Mathematical predicates are also called _open
sentences_ or **expressions.** For example, the following are all
predicates:

1. ${1 + 1}$
2. ${n^2 - 2n > 0}$

The expression ${1+1}$ cannot be evaluated as true or false because it
merely expresses, or communicates, some predicate. In this case, the
predicate ${1+1.}$ What we need is further specification:

1. ${1+1 = 2}$
2. ${1+1 > 3}$
3. ${1+1 \leq 2}$

The same idea extends to the statement ${n^2 - n > 0.}$ We cannot verify
whether this statement is true or false because we don't know what ${n}$ is
an element of. If ${n}$ is any integer, then the statement is false, since
${n=0}$ renders the statement false. If ${n = 3,}$ then the statement is
true.

## Arguments

An **argument** is a sequence of statements leading to an assertion. The
assertion at the end of the sequence is called the **conclusion**, and the
preceding statements are called **premises**.

When we create or assess arguments, there are two things we should always
distinguish: (1) The argument's _intrinsic merit_; and (2) The argument's
_form_. Logical analysis has no business, and provides no help, with an
argument's intrinsic merits. Where it does help, however, is determining
whether a conclusion _necessarily_ follows from the _truth_ of the
premises.

For example, consider the argument: "If taxes are raised, then unemployment
increases. If unemployment increases, then government expenditures
increase. Since government expenditures did not increase, taxes were not
raised." Strictly from a logical analysis, there are no problems with this
argument. But, there may be problems with the argument's intrinsic merits
(is it not the case that government expenditures can go unchanged, or even
decrease, while taxes are raised?). Logic does not help determine whether
the argument's premises are true (Is it true that raising taxes increases
unemployment? Is it true that increased unemployment leads to increased
government expenditures?). Logic can help determine whether the premises
are conclusions that necessarily follow from other premises, but without
more, logical analysis provides no aid here.

## Logical Statements

Arguments consist of **propositions** &mdash; sentences that can be
assigned the values _true_ or _false_, but not both. The entirety of
mathematics is composed of terms defined by using terms previously defined.
This process of using terms to define terms, however, had to start
somewhere. For this reason, there are a few terms in mathematics taken to
be _undefined_. The terms _sentence_, _true_, and _false_, are examples of
undefined terms in mathematics. Following the definition of a proposition,
the following sentences are propositions:

1. ${1 + 1 = 2}$ (true)
2. ${2^2 = 18}$ (false)

The sentence ${x^2 = 16}$ is not a proposition, because we cannot assign it
the value true or false unless we provide some value for $x$. It is both
true or false, depending on $x$.

## Compound Propositions &amp; Logical Connectives

Propositions can be connected with _logical connectives_ to create
**compound propositions**. For example, the propositions "$x$ is less than
_or_ to 4" and "$s$ is a member of $A$ but not a member of $B$" are
examples of compound propositions.

To form compound propositions, the connected propositions must have set
truth values. In other words, we cannot connect propositions that do not
already have the assigned values of _true_ or _false_. Once we _know_ what
the truth values for individual propositions, we can then connect them with
logical connectives. We investigate the most common logical connectives in
the next sections.

### Logical NOT

The logical connective NOT is the _logical negation_. It takes a
proposition, and returns the proposition with the opposite truth value.
More formally: Let $p$ be a proposition. The negation of $p$ is "NOT p,"
or, "It is NOT the case that $p$." We denote the negation of $p$ with
${\neg p.}$ If $p$ is true, then ${\neg p}$ is false; if $p$ is false, then
${\neg p}$ is true.

We can summarize the possibilities with a truth table:

| $p$ | ${\neg p}$ |
| --- | ---------- |
| T   | F          |
| F   | T          |

## The Double Negative Property.

The **double negative property** provides that, given a proposition $p$,
the negation of the negation of $p$ is simply $p$. We can see this to be
the case from the truth table for ${\neg (\neg p)}$:

| $p$ | ${\neg p}$ | ${\neg (\neg p)}$ |
| --- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| T   | F          | T                 |
| F   | T          | F                 |

### Logical AND

The logical connective AND is the _logical conjunction_. If $p$ and $q$ are
propositions, then the conjunction of $p$ and $q$ is "$p$ AND $q$," denoted
${p \land q.}$ If, and only if, $p$ is true and $q$ is true, then
${p \land q}$ is true. If $p$ is false, $q$ is false, or both $p$ and $q$
are false, then ${p \land q}$ is false.

As a truth table:

| $p$ | $q$ | ${p \land q}$ |
| --- | --- | ------------- |
| T   | T   | T             |
| T   | F   | F             |
| F   | T   | F             |
| F   | F   | F             |

## NEITHER NOR

The sentence structure "NEITHER NOR in logic is simply the logical
conjunction of two negations. Thus, suppose $p$ and $q$ are propositions.
The statement "NEITHER $p$ NOR $q$" in logical notation is
${\neg p \land \neg q.}$ For example, consider the proposition "It is
neither hot nor sunny." Let ${h = \text{ "It is hot." }}$ and
${s = \text{ "It is sunny." }}$ The statement, in logic, is reduced to
${\neg h \land \neg s.}$

## BUT

The word BUT is just another word for AND in logic. Thus: Let $p$ and $q$
be propositions. The statement "$p$ BUT $q$ in logical notation is
${p \land q.}$ For example, consider the proposition "It is not hot but it
is sunny." Let ${h = \text{ "It is hot." }}$ and
${s = \text{"It is sunny."}}$ In logical notation, the statement is reduced
to ${\neg h \land s.}$

## Logical OR

The logical connective OR is the _logical disjunction_. Let $p$ and $q$ be
propositions. The disjunction of $p$ and $q$ is "$p$ OR $q$," denoted
${p \lor q.}$ If, and only if, $p$ is true, $q$ is true, or both $p$ and
$q$ are true, then ${p \lor q}$ is true. Otherwise, if both $p$ and $q$ are
false, then ${p \lor q}$ is false.

As a truth table:

| $p$ | $q$ | ${p \lor q}$ |
| --- | --- | ------------ |
| T   | T   | T            |
| T   | F   | T            |
| F   | T   | T            |
| F   | F   | F            |

Note that this definition of OR differs from our more common usage of _or_,
which generally denotes "one or the other, but not both." This common usage
of _or_ is called the **exclusive or**. In mathematics and computer
science, we use the **inclusive or** by default &mdash; "one or the other,
or both." When the _exclusive or_ is used, mathematicians and computer
scientists will make it explicit with sentence structures such as "$A$ or
$B$ but not both," or, occassionally, "Either $A$ or $B$." The _exclusive
or_ (XOR) is covered in later sections.

### Logical XOR

The logical connective XOR, is the _exclusive disjunction_ (the _exlusive
or_). Given propositions $p$ and $q$, the exlusive disjunction of $p$ and
$q$ is "Either $p$ or $q$," or "$p$ or $q$ but not both." It is denoted
${p \oplus q}$.

The proposition ${p \oplus q}$ is true if, and only if, $p$ is true or $q$
is true, but not both. If (a) both $p$ and $q$ are true, or (b) both $p$
and $q$ are false, then ${p \oplus q}$ is false.

| $p$ | $q$ | ${p \oplus q}$ |
| --- | --- | -------------- |
| T   | T   | F              |
| T   | F   | T              |
| F   | T   | T              |
| F   | F   | F              |

Note that ${p \oplus q}$ is the same statement as
${(p \lor q) \land \neg (p \land q).}$ We can verify this with a truth
table:

| $p$ | $q$ | ${p \lor q}$ | ${p \land q}$ | ${\neg (p \land q)}$ | ${(p \lor q) \land \neg (p \land q)}$ | ${p \oplus q}$ |
| --- | --- | ------------ | ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| T   | T   | T            | T             | F                    | F                                     | F              |
| T   | F   | T            | F             | T                    | T                                     | T              |
| F   | T   | T            | F             | T                    | T                                     | T              |
| F   | F   | F            | F             | T                    | F                                     | F              |

## Inequalities and Logic

One of the most common relationships between discrete objects in
mathematics is inequality. Inequalities, as a matter of logic, are just
compound propositions. However, they are so frequent in mathematics that
we've given them special symbols.

Let $x$, $b$, and $a$ be real numbers. The following statements are
compound propositions:

- The statement ${x \leq a}$ means:
  - ${x < a}$ OR
  - ${x = a}$
- The statement ${x \geq a}$ means:
  - ${x > a}$ OR
  - ${x = a}$
- The statement ${a \leq x \leq b}$ means:
  - ${a \leq x}$ AND
  - ${x \leq b}$
- The statement ${a \geq x \geq b}$ means:
  - ${a \geq x}$ AND
  - ${x \geq b}$

## Logical Equivalence &amp; Propositional Forms

Given propositions $p$ and $q$, we can use logical connectives to construct
the compound propositions ${\neg p}$, ${p \land q}$, and ${p \lor q.}$
Compound propositions themselves can be connected to form more complicated
expressions:

- ${\neg p \lor q}$
- ${(\neg p \lor q) \land \neg (p \lor q)}$
- ${\neg ((p \land q) \lor (p \land (p \lor \neg q)))}$

These expressions are called **propositional forms**. When determining a
propositional form's truth value, we follow the _Boolean order of
operations_:

1. Expressions inside brackets/parentheses are performed first
2. The NOT operator is performed second.
3. The operator AND is performed third.
4. The operator OR is performed last.

## Logical Equivalence.

The statements "2 is greater than 1" and "1 is less than 2" are two
different ways of saying the same thing. This is because of the definitions
of the words &#8220;greater than&#8221; and &#8220;less than.&#8221; Both
statements, together, can only be: (1) both true, or (2) both false. In
other words, if the statements were connected with a logical connective and
evaluated in a truth table, their truth values would be identical.

For example, suppose $p$ and $q$ are propositions. The compound
propositions ${p \land q}$ and ${q \land p}$ have the same truth values:

| $p$ | $q$ | ${p \land q}$ | ${q \land p}$ |
| --- | --- | ------------- | ------------- |
| T   | T   | T             | T             |
| T   | F   | F             | F             |
| F   | T   | F             | F             |
| F   | F   | F             | F             |

When two _proposition forms_ have the same truth values, we say that they
are **logically equivalent**. More formally, two proposition forms are
_logically equivalent_ if, and only if, they have identical truth values
for each possible substitution of statements for their statement variables.
The logical equivalence of statement forms $p$ and $q$ is denoted by
writing ${p \equiv q.}$

Two _propositions_ are _logically equivalent_ if, and only if, they have
logically equivalent forms when identical component statement variables are
used to replace component statements. Because of logical equivalence, there
are logical properties we can use in all situations. We will explore some
tactics for evaluating logical equivalences once we've covered conditonals.

## De Morgan's Laws

Consider the proposition: &#8220;Apples are reed and sweet.&#8221; This is
a compound proposition: (1) &#8220;Apples are red&#8221; (2) &#8220;Apples
are sweet&#8221; For the proposition to be false (the proposition's
negation), one or both of (1) and (2) must be false. I.e., "Apples are NOT
red BUT sweet"; "Apples are red BUT NOT sweet"; "Apples are NOT red AND are
NOT sweet." These propositions can be reduced to a single proposition:
"Apples are NOT red OR are NOT sweet."

Similarly, consider the proposition: "Apples are red OR green." Like the
AND proposition above, this is a compound proposition: (1) "Apples are
red." (2) "Apples are green." Thus, for the compound proposition to be
false, both (1) and (2) must be false, because an OR proposition is false
if, and only if, both of its component propositions are false. The negation
then is: "Apples are NOT red AND are NOT green."

DeMorgan's laws formalize this reduction. The negation of an AND
proposition is logically equivalent to the OR proposition in which each
component proposition is _negated_. The negation of an OR statement is
logically equivalent to the AND statement in which each component
proposition is _negated_.

More formally:

> ${\neg (p \land q) \equiv \neg p \lor \neg q}$ >
> ${\neg (p \lor q) \equiv \neg p \land \neg q}$

A truth table demonstrates the logical equivalences:

| $p$ | $q$ | ${\neg p}$ | ${\neg q}$ | ${p \land q}$ | ${\neg (p \land q)}$ | ${\neg p \lor \neg q}$ |
| --- | --- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| T   | T   | F          | F          | T             | F                    | F                      |
| T   | F   | F          | T          | F             | T                    | T                      |
| F   | T   | T          | F          | F             | T                    | T                      |
| F   | F   | T          | T          | F             | T                    | T                      |

Note that the negation of an OR proposition is the same as the NEITHER NOR
proposition. Consider the proposition: "Cats are sympathetic or lively."
The negation of this proposition is "Cats are not sympathetic and are NOT
lively." This is same proposition as "Neither are cats sympathetic nor are
cats lively."

## De Morgan's Laws and Inequalities.

Recall that inequalities are simply compound propositions. Negations of
inequalities are direct results of applying De Morgan's Laws.

The proposition ${x \nless y}$ means that $x$ is NOT to the left of $y$ on
the real number line. This implies:

- $x$ is in the same position as $y$, ${x = y;}$ OR
- $x$ lies to the right of $y$, ${x > y.}$

These two possibilities are ecapsulated in the propostition ${x \geq y.}$

The proposition ${x \ngtr y}$ means that $x$ is NOT to the right of $y$ on
the real number line. This implies:

- $x$ is in the same position as $y$, ${x = y;}$ OR
- $x$ lies to the left of $y$, ${x < y.}$

These two possibilities are encapsulated in the proposition ${x \leq y.}$

The proposition ${x \nleq y}$ means that $x$ is NOT in the same position as
$y$ on the real number line, AND $x$ is NOT to the left of $y$ on the real
number line. This implies:

- $x$ is to the right of $y$ on the real number line; ${x > y.}$

The proposition ${x \ngeq y}$ means that $x$ is NOT in the same position as
$y$ on the real number line, AND $x$ is NOT to the right $y$ on the real
number line. This implies:

- $x$ is to the left of $y$ on the real number line; ${x < y.}$

## De Morgan's Laws and Compound Inequalities

Negating compound inequalities is a common source of error for novices.
Confronted with an inequality of the form ${x < y \leq z}$, it is tempting
to write: ${x \nless y \nleq z.}$ Temptation be gone! This is wrong.

Suppose a compound inequality of the form
${x \stackrel{?}= y
\stackrel{?}= z.}$[^inequality_note] This compound
inequality consists of two component propositions:

[^inequality_note]:
    the symbol ${\stackrel{?}=}$ means "unknown relation," and represents
    the possibility of any of the relation symbols $=$, $>$, $<$, $\leq$,
    $\geq$, etc.

1. ${x \stackrel{?}= y}$ AND
2. ${y \stackrel{?}= z.}$

Thus, the negation of the compound inequality is:

1. ${\neg (x \stackrel{?}= y)}$ OR

2. ${\neg (y \stackrel{?}= z).}$

For example, suppose the compound inequality ${x < y \leq z.}$ The negation
of this proposition is:

1. ${x \nless y}$ OR
2. ${y \nleq z}$.

Proposition (1), ${x \nless y,}$ means that ${x \geq y}$. Proposition (2),
${x \nleq z,}$ means that ${y > z.}$ Thus, the negation of the proposition,
reduced, is:

1. ${x \geq y}$ OR
2. ${y > z}$.

It follows that the negation of ${x < y \leq z}$ leaves several
possibilities:

1. ${x > y}$ OR
2. ${x = y}$ OR
3. ${y > z}$

Below are the negations of common compound inequalities:

$$
\neg (x < y \leq z) \to \begin{cases} x > y \text{ or } \\ x = y \text{
or } \\ y > z \end{cases}
$$

$$
\neg (x \leq y < z) \to \begin{cases} x > y \text{ or } \\ y = z \text{
or } \\ y > z \end{cases}
$$

$$
\neg (x > y \geq z) \to \begin{cases} x < y \text{ or } \\ x = y \text{
or } \\ y < z \end{cases}
$$

$$
\neg (x \geq y > z) \to \begin{cases} x < y \text{ or } \\ y = z \text{
or } \\ y < z \end{cases}
$$

$$
\neg (x > y > z) \to \begin{cases} x < y \text{ or } \\ x = y \text{ or
} \\ y = z \text{ or } \\ y < z \end{cases}
$$

$$
\neg (x < y < z) \to \begin{cases} x > y \text{ or } \\ x = y \text{ or
} \\ y > z \text{ or } \\ y = z \end{cases}
$$

$$
\neg (x \leq y \leq z) \to \begin{cases} x > y \text{ or } \\ y > z
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\neg (x \geq y \geq z) \to \begin{cases} x < y \text{ or } \\ y < z
\end{cases}
$$

Whenever we attempt to prove that the negation of a compound inequality is
true, we must prove at least one of the possible cases implied by the
negation.

## Tautologies

A **tautology** is a propositional form that is _always true_ regardless of
the truth values of the individual propositions substituted for the
propositional form's variables. A proposition whose form is a tautology is
called a **tautological proposition**.

For example, consider the proposition: "Beijing is the capital of China OR
Beijing is NOT the capital of China." Let
${p = \text{Beijing is the capital of China.}}$ The proposition in logic
notation: ${p \lor \neg p.}$ As a truth table:

| $p$ | $\neg p$ | ${p \lor \neg p}$ |
| --- | -------- | ----------------- |
| T   | F        | T                 |
| F   | T        | T                 |

From the truth table above, we can see that ${p \lor \neg p}$ will always
be true, regardless of what truth values are assigned to $p$. Thus, we say
that ${p \lor \neg p}$ is a tautology:

$$
	\top (p \lor \neg p)
$$

The symbol $\top$ is called the _verum_ symbol, and represents a "true". We
attach it next to the parentheses containing the relevant proposition to
indicate that the proposition is a tautology.

## Contradictions

The polar opposite of a tautology is a **contraction** &mdash; a
propositional form that is _always false_, regardless of the truth values
of the individual propositions substituted for the propositional form's
variables. A proposition whose form is a contradiction is called a
**contradictory proposition**.

Example: Consider the proposition "Dogs are canines AND dogs are NOT
canines." Let ${d = \text{Dogs are canines.}}$ In logic notation, the
proposition is: ${d \land \neg d.}$ As a truth table:

| $d$ | $\neg d$ | ${d \land \neg d}$ |
| --- | -------- | ------------------ |
| T   | F        | F                  |
| F   | T        | F                  |

From the table above, we can see that ${d \land \neg d}$ is always false,
regardless of the truth value of $d$. Thus, we say that ${d \land \neg d}$
is a contradictory proposition. We denote this fact with the logical
notation:

$$
	\bot (d \land \neg d)
$$

The symbol $\bot$ is the _falsum_ symbol, and denotes false. We attach it
next to the parentheses containing the relevant proposition to indicate
that the proposition is a contradiction.

## Boolean Laws

The following are several helpful boolean laws.

### Boolean Commutative Law.

The proposition "The United States is a Western country and a country in
the Americas" is logically equivalent to the proposition "The United States
is a country in the Americas and a Western country." Similarly, the
proposition "China is an ancient or old civilization" is logically
equivalent to "China is an old or ancient civilization." These statements
are true because of the Boolean commutative law:

> _Boolean Commutative Law._ Given propositions $p$ and $q$,
>
> - ${p \land q \equiv q \land p}$ and
> - ${p \lor q \equiv q \lor p}$

A truth table proves the Boolean commutative law:

| $p$ | $q$ | ${p \land q}$ | ${q \land p}$ | ${p \lor q}$ | ${q \lor p}$ |
| --- | --- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| T   | T   | T             | T             | T            | T            |
| T   | F   | F             | F             | T            | T            |
| F   | T   | F             | F             | T            | T            |
| F   | F   | F             | F             | F            | F            |

## Boolean Associative Law.

The proposition &#8220;${x}$ is even and greater than 4, and ${x}$ is a
perfect square&#8221; is equivalent to &#8220;${x}$ is even, and ${x}$ is
greater than 4 and a perfect square.&#8221; Similarly, the proposition
&#8220;${n}$ is red or blue, or ${n}$ is green&#8221; is equivalent to
&#8220;${n}$ is red, or ${n}$ is is blue or green.&#8221; We can rest
assured that these statements are true because of the Boolean associative
law:

> _Boolean Associative Law_. Given propositions $p$ and $q$:
>
> - ${(p \land q) \land r \equiv p \land (q \land r)}$ and
> - ${(p \lor q) \lor r \equiv p \lor (q \lor r)}$

A truth table provides a proof. Notice that both ${p \land q} \land r$ and
${p \land (q \land r)}$ have the same truth values, regardless of the
values of $p$, $q$, and ${r.}$

| $p$ | $q$ | $r$ | ${p \land q}$ | ${q \land r}$ | ${(p \land q) \land r}$ | ${p \land (q \land r)}$ |
| --- | --- | --- | ------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| T   | T   | T   | T             | T             | T                       | T                       |

### Boolean Distributive Law

The **Boolean distributive law** states:

> Given propositions $p$ and ${q,}$
>
> - ${p \land (q \lor r) \equiv (p \land q) \lor (p \land r);}$ and
> - ${p \lor (q \land r) \equiv (p \lor q) \land (p \lor r)}$

A truth table demonstrates the distributive law to be true. It is omitted
here due to its size.

### Boolean Identity Law

The **Boolean identity law** states:

> Given a proposition $p$ and a tautological proposition ${\top(q)}$
>
> - ${p \land \top(q) \equiv p}$ Given a proposition $p$ and a
>   contradictory proposition ${\bot(r)}$
> - ${p \land \bot(r) \equiv p}$

Truth table:

| p   | ${\top(q)}$ | ${\bot(r)}$ | ${p \land \top(q)}$ | ${p \land \bot(r)}$ |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| T   | T           | T           | F                   | F                   |
| F   | T           | F           | F                   | F                   |

### Boolean Negation Law

The **Boolean negation law** provides:

> Given a proposition ${p,}$
>
> - ${p \lor \neg p \equiv \top}$
> - ${p \land \neg p \equiv \bot}$

In other words, ${p \lor \neg p}$ is a tautological proposition, and
${p \land \neg p}$ is a contradictory proposition.

| $p$ | $\neg p$ | ${p \lor \neg p}$ | ${p \land \neg p}$ |
| --- | -------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| T   | F        | T                 | F                  |
| F   | T        | T                 | F                  |

### Boolean Double Negation Law

The **Boolean double negation law** provides:

> Given a proposition ${p,}$
>
> - ${\neg (\neg p) \equiv p}$

| $p$ | $\neg p$ | $\neg (\neg p)$ |
| --- | -------- | --------------- |
| T   | F        | T               |

### Indempotent Laws

The **indempotent laws** state:

> Let ${p}$ be a proposition. Then:
>
> - ${p \land p \equiv p,}$ and
> - ${p \lor p \equiv p}$

### Universal Bound Laws

The **universal bound laws** provide:

> Given a proposition $p$, a tautological proposition ${\top(q)}$, and a
> contradictory proposition ${\bot(r),}$
>
> - ${p \lor \top(q) \equiv \top,}$ and
> - ${p \land \bot(r) \equiv \bot}$

### De Morgans Laws

**De Morgan's laws** state:

> Given propositions $p$ and ${q,}$
>
> - ${\neg (p \land q) \equiv \neg p \lor \neg q,}$ and
> - ${\neg (p \lor q) \equiv \neg p \land \neg q}$

### Absorption Laws

The **absorption laws** provide:

> Given propositions $p$ and $q$,
>
> - ${p \lor (p \land q) \equiv p;}$ and
> - ${p \land (p \lor q) \equiv p}$

### Negations of Tautologies and Contractions

> Given a statement $p$, ${\neg (\top(p)) \equiv \bot(p)}$ Similarly,
> ${\neg (\bot(p)) \equiv \top(p)}$

## Conditional Statements

When we reason _from_ a hypothesis to a _conclusion_, we make a
**deduction**. This act is embodied in the statement:

> If $p$ then ${q.}$

We call this statement a **conditional**, and we denote it with:

> ${p \implies q}$

The symbol ${\implies}$ is a _logical connective_, just like ${\land}$,
${\lor}$, ${\neg}$, etc. The proposition $p$ is called the **sufficient
condition**, and the proposition $q$ is called the **necessary
condition**.[^implies_note].

[^implies_note]:
    In the order of operations, the logical connective ${\implies}$ is
    performed last.

### When is a conditional false?

Consider the following statement:

    If Paris picks Hera, then there will be no war.

When is this statement false? It is false if, and only if, Paris picks Hera
and there is a war (i.e., the sufficient condition is true and the
necessary condition is false). Otherwise, the conditional ${p
\implies q}$
is true. Truth table:

| $p$ | $q$ | ${p \implies q}$ |
| --- | --- | ---------------- |
| T   | T   | T                |
| T   | F   | F                |
| F   | T   | T                |
| F   | F   | T                |

If a conditional proposition's necessary condition, or conclusion, is true
because its sufficient condition is false, we say that the proposiiton is
**vacuously true** or **true by default**. For example, consider the
proposition:

    If Hera is not related to Zeus, then Hera is Zeus's wife.

This conditional proposition is vacuously true if Hera is related to Zeus
(a false sufficient condition), and Hera is Zeus's wife (a true
conclusion).

## Conditionals & Logical Equivalence.

Conditionals can be tricky to determine the logical equivalence for. There
are three ways to determine whether propositions are logically equivalent:
(1) Construct a truth table; (2) apply a sequence of known logical
equivalences; or (3) divergent thinking.

As we've seen, truth tables are the most explicit way to confirm that
propositions are logically equivalent. But, truth tables are very easy to
make mistakes with. Moreover, if we have ${n}$ propositions, the number of
rows for the truth table is ${2^n}$ &mdash; the table grows exponentially
with the number of propositions. After 2 through 3 propositions, we're much
more likely to either exhaust ourselves or make mistakes. They simply don't
scale well.

The second approach is to use a sequence of known logical equivalences.
Here, we perform logical evaluations much like algebra. We substitute known
logical equivalences with variables, and evaluate accordingly. This
approach can be particularly effective when used alongside truth tables.
The risk here with logical equivalences is going around in circles. It's
very easy to fall into duplicated analyses. We avoid this problem by having
a clear plan for evaluation.

The third approach is what we call &#8220;divergent thinking.&#8221; With
this approach, we use a mixture of intuition, analogy, and modularity.
There really isn't a set formula for this approach. We break down the
problem into smaller pieces, and ask ourselves what should be true? What
should be false? We can also substitute words in the propositions to check
if they make sense intuitively. This approach usually yields informal
arguments, so it's often necessary to use the other two approaches for
confirmation. Fortunately, divergent thinking tends to yield plans helpful
for the second approach.

For example, suppose we had the proposition ${p \implies (q \implies r).}$
Using the divergent thinking approach, we ask ourselves, &#8220;When is
this proposition false?&#8221; Well, we know that an implication is false
when the sufficient condition is true and the necessary condition is false.
So, we turn to the necessary condition. When is the necessary condition
false? Again, when the sufficient condition is true and the necessary
condition is false. Thus, the proposition ${p \implies (q \implies r)}$ is
false iff ${p \implies (q \implies (\neg r).}$ Or, by logical equivalence,
${a \implies q \land (\neg r).}$ Thus, ${p \implies (q \implies r)}$ is
false if, and only if, ${p}$ and ${q}$ are true, and ${r}$ is false. We can
then draw a logical equivalence:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		p \implies (q \implies r) &\equiv (\neg p) \lor (q \implies r) \\
		&\equiv (\neg p) \lor (\neg q \lor r) \\
		&\equiv (\neg p) \lor (\neg q) \lor r
	\end{aligned}
$$

$$
	\neg (p \implies (q \implies r)) \equiv p \land q \land (\neg r)
$$

### Division Into Cases

A frequent analysis in mathematics is dividing propositions into cases.
Whenever we encounter a conditional of the form:

$$
	a \lor b \implies c
$$

there are two cases:

$$
	(a \lor b \implies c) \space \begin{cases} a \implies c \\ b \implies c \end{cases}
$$

Thus, to prove that ${a \lor b \implies c}$ is true, we must prove that:

1. ${a \implies c}$ is true;
2. ${b \implies c}$ is true; or
3. both ${a \implies c}$ and ${b \implies c}$ is true

## Implications as Logical Disjunctions

The _if..then.._ proposition is logically equivalent to the _or_
proposition. In fact, this is apparent from every day speech. Consider the
statement:

    "Either you study or you receive poor grades."

Suppose ${\neg s \coloneqq \texttt{"you study"}}$ and
${r \coloneqq \texttt{"you receive poor grades"}.}$ Accordingly,
${s \coloneqq \texttt{"you do not study"}.}$ Thus,
${(\neg s) \lor r \coloneqq \texttt{"You study OR you receive poor grades"}.}$
The equivalent proposition is ${s \implies r:}$

    "If you do not study, then you receive poor grades."

We can see that this is true with truth table:

| $p$ | $q$ | ${\neg p}$ | ${p \implies q}$ | ${(\neg p) \lor q}$ |
| --- | --- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| T   | T   | F          | T                | T                   |
| T   | F   | F          | F                | F                   |
| F   | T   | T          | T                | T                   |
| F   | F   | T          | T                | T                   |

Both ${p \implies q}$ and ${\neg p \lor q}$ have the same truth values;
they are logically equivalent.Similarly, if ${q \implies p,}$ then
${(q \implies p) \equiv ((\neg q) \lor p).}$

| $q$ | $p$ | ${\neg q}$ | ${q \implies p}$ | ${(\neg q) \lor p}$ |
| --- | --- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| T   | T   | F          | T                | T                   |
| T   | F   | F          | F                | F                   |
| F   | T   | T          | T                | T                   |
| F   | F   | T          | T                | T                   |

Accordingly, we have the following logical equivalence:

> _Lemma_. Given propositions ${p}$ and ${q,}$
>
> - ${p \implies q \equiv q \lor (\neg p)}$, _or_
> - ${p \implies q \equiv (\neg p) \lor q}$

## Negative Implications

The fact that ${(p \implies q) \equiv ((\neg p) \lor q)}$ yields several
inferences:

Negating both sides:

$$
	\neg (p \implies q) \equiv \neg ((\neg p) \lor q)
$$

Applying De Morgan's laws:

$$
	\neg (p \implies q) \equiv \neg ((\neg p) \lor q)
$$

By the double negative law:

$$
	\neg (p \implies q) \equiv p \land (\neg q)
$$

Thus, we have the following fact:

$$
	\neg (p \implies q) \equiv (p \land \neg q)
$$

In other words, the negation of ${\text{"If p then q"}}$ is
${\text{"p and not q"}.}$ We can see this in everyday speech with the word
"but." For example:

    	"If I timely submit my assignment, I will not lose points"
    	"I timely submit my assignment, but I lose points."

For those fond of Victorian horror:

    	Proposition: "If Dracula is a man, then Dracula is human"
    	Negation: "Dracula is a man but not human."

Accordingly, we have the following theorem:

> _Lemma_. Given propositions ${p}$ and ${q,}$
>
> $$
>   \neg (p \implies q) \equiv \neg [q \lor (\neg p)] \equiv (\neg q) \land p
> $$

As an aside, the last example might spark some thought about how we assign
truth values to propositions. Consider for example Immanuel Kant's
observation of three values: the "alive," the "dead," and somewhere in the
middle, the "undead." Is there any relationship between the fact that these
terms exist and how we evaluate the truth values of propositions? If the
answer is yes, does the relationship affect the proposition that such a
relationship exists?

## The Contrapositive

A foundational law of logic is the equivalence between a conditonal and its
**contrapositive**. Suppose the statement, If I go to class, then I will
attend lecture." The contrapositive of this proposition is: If I do not
attend lecture, then I do not go to class."

More formally: Given a conditional of the form ${p \implies q}$, its
contrapositive is

$$
	(\neg q) \implies (\neg p)
$$

A conditional is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. We can see
that this is true with a proof table. Suppose $a$ and $b$ are propositions.

| $a$ | $b$ | ${\neg b}$ | ${\neg a}$ | ${a \implies b}$ | ${(\neg b) \implies (\neg a)}$ |
| --- | --- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| T   | T   | F          | F          | T                | T                              |
| T   | F   | T          | F          | F                | F                              |
| F   | T   | F          | T          | T                | T                              |
| F   | F   | T          | T          | T                | T                              |

The fact that a conditional's contrapositive is logically equivalent to the
conditional is a valuable asset. Often, proving a conditional proposition's
contrapositive is much easier than proving the conditional proposition
itself.

### The Converse

The **converse** of a proposition is formed when the proposition's
necessary and sufficient conditions are switched:

    	Proposition: "If Bo is a horse, then Bo is a mammal."
    	Converse: "If Bo is a mammal, then Bo is a horse."

Formally: Given a conditional of the form ${p \implies q,}$ its _converse_
is

$$
	q \implies p
$$

The converse of a conditional is not logically equivalent to the
conditional. We can see that this is true with a truth table. Let $p$ and
$q$ be propositions:

| $p$ | $q$ | ${p \implies q}$ | ${q \implies p}$ |
| --- | --- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| T   | T   | T                | T                |
| T   | F   | F                | T                |
| F   | T   | T                | F                |
| F   | F   | T                | T                |

## The Inverse

The **inverse** of a conditional is the conditional formed from negating
the sufficient and necessary conditions while keeping their order in place:

    	Proposition: "If Bo is a horse, then Bo is a mammal."
    	Inverse: "If Bo is not a horse, then Bo is not a mammal."

Formally: Given a conditional of the form ${p \implies q,}$ its _inverse_
is:

$$
	(\neg q) \implies (\neg p)
$$

Like the converse, the inverse of a conditional is not logically equivalent
to the conditional:

| $p$ | $q$ | ${\neg p}$ | ${\neg q}$ | ${p \implies q}$ | ${(\neg p) \implies (\neg q)}$ |
| --- | --- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| T   | T   | F          | F          | T                | T                              |
| T   | F   | F          | T          | F                | T                              |
| F   | T   | T          | F          | T                | F                              |
| F   | F   | T          | T          | T                | T                              |

### Equivalence of Converse and Inverse.

Although both the converse and inverse of a conditional are not logically
equivalent to the conditional, the converse of a conditional is logically
equivalent to the inverse of a conditional, and vice versa.

| $p$ | $q$ | ${\neg p}$ | ${\neg q}$ | ${p \implies q}$ | ${q \implies p}$ | ${(\neg p) \implies (\neg q)}$ |
| --- | --- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| T   | T   | F          | F          | T                | T                | T                              |
| T   | F   | F          | T          | F                | T                | T                              |
| F   | T   | T          | F          | F                | F                | F                              |
| F   | F   | T          | T          | F                | T                | T                              |

## &#8220;Only if&#8221;

The phrase **only if** introduces a necessary condition. In other words,
when we say "A only if B", we are saying "If A occurs, B MUST occur;" that
is, "If b does not occur, a does not occur."

Formally, given propositions $a$ and $b$, the proposition "$a$ only if $b$"
is denoted as:

$$
	a \implies b
$$

or, equivalently,

$$
	(\neg b) \implies (\neg a)
$$

## The Biconditional

A **biconditional proposition** (a "biconditional") is a conditional
proposition where both component propositions are the necessary and
sufficient conditions. The biconditional most often takes the form "$p$ if,
and only if, $q$". The words _if and only if_ are sometimes abbreviated
**iff**, and we will follow this convention.

More formally: Given propositions $p$ and ${q,}$ the **biconditional** of
$p$ and $q$ is "$p$ iff $q$" denoted:

$$
	p \iff q
$$

The biconditional ${p \iff q}$ is true if both $p$ and $q$ have the same
true values and is false if $p$ and $q$ have opposite truth values. The
biconditional has the truth table:

| $p$ | $q$ | ${p \iff q}$ |
| --- | --- | ------------ |
| T   | T   | T            |
| T   | F   | F            |
| F   | T   | F            |
| F   | F   | T            |

Consider the following truth table:

| $p$ | $q$ | ${p \implies q}$ | ${q \implies p}$ | ${p \iff q}$ | ${(p \implies q) \land (q \implies p)}$ |
| --- | --- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| T   | T   | T                | T                | T            | T                                       |
| T   | F   | F                | T                | F            | F                                       |
| F   | T   | T                | F                | F            | F                                       |
| F   | F   | T                | T                | T            | T                                       |

Observe that the biconditional "$p$ iff $q$" is logically equivalent to
"$p$ if $q$ and $q$ if $p$." In other words, the biconditional is logically
equivalent to the conjunction of the conditional and its converse.
Symbolically:

$$
	(p \iff q) \equiv ((p \implies q) \land (q \implies p))
$$

This is helpful result. Biconditionals are much easier to prove or work
with when they are reduced to the conditional and its converse.

In the Boolean order of operations, the connective ${\iff}$ is coequal with
${\implies.}$ Like ${\land}$ and ${\lor,}$ the only way to indicate one's
precedence over the other is to use parentheses. Thus, the Boolean order of
operations thus far proceeds as such:

1. ${(\space \space)}$ | Parentheses are always examined before everything
   else.

2. ${\neg}$ | Negations are evaluated first.

3. ${\land,}$ ${\lor}$ | AND and OR are evaluated second.

4. ${\implies,}$ ${\iff}$ | IF-THEN and IF-AND-ONLY-IF are evaluated last.

Consider some examples.

Construct the truth table: ${p \lor \neg q \implies \neg p}$

First, note that
${p \lor \neg q \implies \neg p \equiv (p \lor (\neg q)) \implies (\neg p).}$

Prove ${p \lor q \implies r \equiv (p \implies r) \land (q \implies r)}$

The proposition is proved with a truth table:

| $p$ | $q$ | $r$ | ${p \lor q}$ | ${(p \lor q) \implies r}$ | ${p \implies r}$ | ${q \implies r}$ | ${(p \implies r) \land (q \implies r)}$ |

Both ${(p \lor q \implies r)}$ and ${(p \implies r) \land (q \implies r)}$
have the same truth values; they are logically equivalent.
