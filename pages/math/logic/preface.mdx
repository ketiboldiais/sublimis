# Logic

Logic provides the foundations of mathematics. For this reason, we devote
an entirely separate volume for its study. Without logic, mathematics would
not stand. And without mathematics astand, the world as we know it would
crumble. But the field of logic is not purely sequestered to the
mathematical domain. Running like ivy, we see logic in metaphysics,
epistemology, the sciences, politics, economics, medicine, law &mdash; we
would exhaust ourselves before tracing all of its reaches.

Where the natural sciences and mathematics provide tools to interrogate the
world we live in, logic is the final arbiter of our findings. Like the
Egyptian god Maat, it divorces fact from fiction, identifying truth from
falsity. At times, it does so with clarity and fine lines, austere and cold
in beauty. At others, it speaks to us like a Delphic oracle &mdash;
divining the truth in mysterious, esoteric ways.

Our study in this volume focuses on how to use, analyze, and interpret the
dictates of logic. We will find that much of everyday speech conflicts with
logic, and for that reason, we depend heavily on symbols. We will see how
certain logical conclusions appear nonsensical and unintuitive, but we
cannot escape them. We will experience awe and disbelief when we realize
there are, in fact, exits. We will learn that the antagonist in all of this
is doubt. We will discover that logic attempts to eradicate this villain
repeatedly. And just when we think we've witnessed doubt's demise, the
scene cuts to a hand reaching out the water.
