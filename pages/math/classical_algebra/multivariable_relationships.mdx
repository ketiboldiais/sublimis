# Multivariable Relationships

Suppose we know the following relationship:

$$
	a + b = c
$$

Three number relationships are ripe for inferences. If we add ${ -b }$ to
both sides of the equation, we obtain ${ a + b - b = c - b }$. Simplifying,
we have ${ a + 0 = c - b }$. We can then infer:

$$
	a = c - b \\
	b = c - a
$$

Let's consider a few examples.

1. Add 357 + 17999 + 1 without paper and pencil.

$$
\begin{aligned}
	357 + 17999 + 1 &= 357 + (17999 + 1)\\
	&= 357 + (18000)\\
	&= 18357
\end{aligned}
$$

2. Add 899 + 1343 + 101 without paper and pencil.

   $$
    \begin{aligned}
   		899 + 1343 + 101 &= (899 + 1) + 1343 + (101 - 1) \\
   		&= (900) + 1343 + (100) \\
   		&= (1000) + 1343 \\
   		&= 2343
    \end{aligned}
   $$

3. Prove: ${ (a + b) + (c + d) = (a + d) + (b + c) }$

   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   	(a + b) + (c + d) &= (a + d + b + c) ~\text{by commutativity} \\
   	&= (a + d) + (b + c) ~\text{by associativity}
   \end{aligned}
   $$

4. Prove: ${ (a + b) + (c + d) = (a + c) + (b + d) }$

$$
\phantom{(a + b) + (c + d)} = (a + b + c + d) ~\text{by associativity} \\
\phantom{(a + b) + (c + d)} = (a + c + b + d) ~\text{by commutativity} \\
\phantom{(a + b) + (c + d)} = (a + c) + (b + d) ~\text{by associativity}
$$

5. Prove: ${(a - b) + (c - d) = (a + c) + (-b - d).}$
   - Following the rule ${n - m = n + (-m),}$
     ${(a - b) + (c - d) = (a + (-b)) + (c + (-d))}$.
   - Then, by associativity,
     ${(a + (-b)) + (c + (-d)) = a + (-b) + c + (-d)}$.
   - By commutativity, ${a + (-b) + c + (-d) = (a + c) + ((-b) + (-d)).}$
   - Following the rule ${n - m = n + (-m)}$, it follows that
     ${(a + c) + ((-b) + (-d)) = (a + c) + (-b - d).}$
   - Therefore, ${(a - b) + (c - d) = (a + c) + (-b - d).}$
