# Proportions

## Ratios

The **ratio** of two quantities tells us the relative _sizes_ of the
quantities. For example, if we say, "There were 3 bachelors for every 5
bachelorettes," are expressing the ratio:

$$
	\dfrac{\text{bachelors}}{\text{bachelorettes}} = \dfrac{3}{5} = 3:5
$$

The use of a colon is often helpful when expressing the relative sizes of
the quantities of multiple discrete objects: The sentence, "For every 1
house on Main Street, there are 2 cats and 100 mice," may be expressed as:
${1:2:100.}$

Example: The ratio of instructors to professors at the conference is 3:4.
There are 84 total conference attendees, of which only instructors and
professors attended.

Suppose ${a}$ is the number of instructors, and ${b}$ is the number of
professors. Write an equation using the ratio information. Remember, a
ratio tells us nothing about the actual sizes of the sets. It only gives us
_relative sizes_. Thus, we know that:

$$
	\dfrac{\text{number of instructors}}{\text{number of professors}} = \dfrac{a}{b} = \dfrac{3}{4}
$$

Write an equation using the total number of conference attendees. We know
that only instructors and professors attended. Hence:

$$
	a + b = 84
$$

Question: How many professors were at the conference? We solve the system
of equations. First, isolate the ${a}$ in the first equation:

$$
	\dfrac{a}{b} = \dfrac{3}{4} \\
	a = \dfrac{3b}{4}
$$

Then, substitute:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	a + b = 84 \\
	\dfrac{3b}{4} + b = 84 \\
	\dfrac{3b + 4b}{4} = 84 \\
	\dfrac{7b}{4} = 84 \\
	7b = 331 \\
	b = 48
\end{aligned}
$$

Example: The ratio of papayas to mangoes to rambutans in the fruit basket
is 2:3:30. Only papayas, mangoes, and rambutans comprise the fruit basket.

What is the number of mangoes to the number of fruits in the fruit basket?

From the ratio, we know that there are at least 2 papayas, 3 mangoes, and
30 rambutans. Thus, there ${2 + 3 + 30 = 35}$ total fruits. Hence:

$$
	\dfrac{m}{t} = \dfrac{3}{35}
$$

Suppose there are 385 fruits in the fruit basket. How many mangoes are
there? The ratio of mangoes to fruits is ${\dfrac{3}{35}.}$ Thus, we have:

$$
	\dfrac{3}{35} = \dfrac{t_m}{385}
$$

where ${t_m}$ is the total amount of mangoes. Solving for ${t_m}$:

$$
	\dfrac{3}{35} = \dfrac{t_m}{385} \\
	35t_m = 3 \cdot 385 \\
	t_m = \dfrac{3 \cdot 11 \cdot 35}{35}\\
	\phantom{t_m} = 33
$$

Exercise. Shylock has a jewel box filled with only emeralds and rubies. The
ratio of emeralds to the total number of jewels in the box is ${2:5.}$ If
Shylock adds 4 emeralds and removes 10 rubies, there will be twice as many
emeralds in the box as rubies. How many jewels were in the box originally?

Let ${e}$ be the number of emeralds, ${r}$ the number of rubies, and ${t}$
the total number of jewels. We know that the box consists only of emeralds
and rubies, so:

$$
	e + r = t
$$

Thus, the original ratio of emeralds to jewels can be expressed as:

$$
	\dfrac{e}{e + r} = \dfrac{2}{5}
	5e = 2(e + r)
	5e = 2e + 2r
	3e = 2r
$$

Next, we are told that if Shylock adds 4 emeralds and removes 10 rubies,
there are twice as many emeralds in the box as there are rubies. This
statement expresses a ratio:

$$
	\dfrac{e + 4}{r - 10} = \dfrac{2}{1} = 2
$$

Once more, we can express this ratio as a linear equation:

$$
	\dfrac{e + 4}{r - 10} = \dfrac{2}{1} = 2 \\
	2(r - 10) = e + 4 \\
	2r - 20 = e + 4
$$

We know ${2r = 3e,}$ so we can substitute:

$$
	3e - 20 = e + 4
	2e = 24
	e = 12
$$

Since ${e = 12,}$ we know there are
${r = \dfrac{3e}{2} = \dfrac{3(12)}{2} = \dfrac{36}{2} = 18}$ rubies. Thus,
there are ${e + r = 12 + 18 = 30}$ jewels in the box.

Exercise. 9 out of every 11 of Daniel's lawyers recommended against the
merger. The rest said recommended it. 18 of Daniel's lawyers recommended
the merger. How many lawyers does Daniel have?

Suppose ${a}$ is the number of lawyers against the merger, and ${t}$ is the
total number of lawyers. Thus, we have the following ratio:

$$
	\dfrac{a}{t} = \dfrac{9}{11}
$$

Since there are exactly 18 lawyers who recommend against the merger, there
are ${t - 18}$ lawyers who recommend the merger. Thus:

$$
	\dfrac{t - 18}{t} = \dfrac{9}{11}
$$

Now we merely must solve for ${t:}$

$$
	\dfrac{t - 18}{t} = \dfrac{9}{11} \\
	11(t - 18) = 9t \\
	11t - 198 = 9t \\
	-198 = -2t \\
	99 = t
$$

Daniel has 99 lawyers &mdash; a hefty bill.

Exercise. The ratio of correct answers to all answers is 7/10. What is the
ratio of incorrect answers to the number of correct answers?

Because there are at least 7 correct answers, the remaining 3 answers are
incorrect answers. Thus, the ratio of incorrect answers to correct answers
is 3/7.

Exercise. Nio is given a bag filled with pills. There are only red, blue,
and green pills. The ratio of red pills to blue pills to green pills is
${1:5:3.}$ There are 27 green pills in the bag. How many total pills are in
the bag?

We know there are 27 green pills. For every 3 of those pills, there is 1
red pill. Thus, there are ${27 / 3 = 9}$ red pills. Then, for every 1 red
pill, there are 5 blue pills. Thus, there are ${9 \cdot 5 = 45}$ blue
pills. The total number of pills then is:

$$
	9 + 45 + 27 = 81
$$

pills. Alternatively, we know that with just the ratio, there are
${1 + 5 + 3 = 9}$ total pills. Hence, the ratio of green pills to total
pills is ${3/9 = 1/3.}$ Suppose ${t}$ is the total number of pills in the
bag. Because there are 27 green pills total, we have:

$$
	\dfrac{27}{x} = \dfrac{1}{3} \\
	x = 27 \cdot 3 \\
	\phantom{x} = 81
$$

Exercise. Two-thirds of Thneedville's residents voted for executing
Order 66. If 634 residents did not vote for executing Order 66, how many
residents does Thneedville have?

Since 2/3 voted for, we know that 1/3 did not vote for. We know that 634
total did not vote for, so we have the ratio:

$$
	\dfrac{1}{3} = \dfrac{634}{t}
$$

where ${t}$ is the total. Solving for ${t:}$

$$
	t = 634 \cdot 3 \\
	\phantom{t} = 1902
$$

Thneedville has a total of 1,902 residents.

Exercise. Count Dracula changes height several times. The ratio of his
original height to his second height is 24:5. The ratio of his second
height to his third height is 1:12. The ratio of his original height to his
fourth height is 16:1. The tallest of these four heights is 10 meters. What
is Dracula's shortest height?

There are four heights total. We denote each with ${h_1,}$ ${h_2,}$
${h_3,}$ and ${h_4.}$ We thus have the following ratios:

$$
	\dfrac{h_1}{h_2} = \dfrac{24}{5} \\
	\dfrac{h_2}{h_3} = \dfrac{1}{12} \\
	\dfrac{h_1}{h_4} = \dfrac{16}{1}
$$

Since ${h_1 : h_2}$ is ${24 : 5,}$ we know that ${h_2 : h_1}$ is
${5 : 24.}$ This means that ${h_2}$ is ${5/24}$ of ${h_1.}$

$$
	h_2 = \dfrac{5}{24}h_1
$$

Then, since ${h_2:h_3}$ is ${1:12,}$ we know that ${h_3}$ is 12 times the
second height:

$$
	h_3 = 12h_2 = 12 \left( \dfrac{5}{24} \right)
$$

Since ${h_1 : h_4 = 16:1,}$ the original height is 16 times the fourth
height. Thus,

$$
	h_4 = \dfrac{x}{16}
$$

From the analysis thus far, we have:

$$
	h_1 \\
	h_2 = \dfrac{5h_1}{24} \\
	h_3 = \dfrac{5h_1}{2} \\
	h_4 = \dfrac{h_1}{16}
$$

Of these values, ${h_3}$ is the largest, since its constant multiplier is
${5/2.}$ Hence, we solve for ${x}$ with 10:

$$
	\dfrac{5x}{2} = 10 \\
	5x = 20 \\
	x = 20/5 \\
	x = 4
$$

The shortest height is ${h_4,}$ since its constant multiplier is ${1/16.}$
Evaluating:

$$
	h_4 = \dfrac{4}{16} = 0.25
$$

Hence, Count Dracula's shortest height is ${0.25}$ meters.

Exercise. What is the ratio of ${x}$ to ${y}$ if:

$$
	\dfrac{10x - 3y}{13x - 2y} = \dfrac{3}{5}
$$

The objective is rewrite the equation to express a relation of
${\dfrac{x}{y}.}$ The key is cross multiplication:

$$
	\dfrac{10x - 3y}{13x - 2y} = \dfrac{3}{5} \\
	5(10x - 3y) = 3(13x - 2y) \\
	50x - 15y = 39x - 6y \\
	11x = 9y \\
	\dfrac{x}{y} = \dfrac{9}{11}
$$

Exercise. If ${x/y = 2/3}$ and ${y/z = 7/5,}$ then what is ${z/x?}$

## Percentages

The word **percent** is likely an abbreviation for the pseudo-Latin _per
centum_, meaning "per hundred." Denoted by the ${\%,}$ a percent is a
shorthand for ${n/100,}$ where ${n}$ ${n \in \R.}$ Thus,
${1/4 = 25/100 = 25\%.}$

Exercise. What percent of 240 is 48?

We solve for ${x}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
		240 (x/100) &= 48 \\
		x/100 &= 48/240 \\
		x &= 100(48/240) \\
		&= 4800/240 \\
		&= 480/24 \\
		&= 20
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, ${48}$ is ${20\%}$ of ${240.}$ Of course, we could have found the
percentage with simple arithmetic: ${48/240 = 0.2.}$ Then, multiplying
${0.2}$ by ${100,}$ we get ${20\%.}$ We used algebra first because it
provides the appropriate approach for handling more complex percentage
problems.

Exercise. 36 is ${120\%}$ of what number?

We solve for ${x:}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
	x(120/100) &= 36 \\
	x(12/10) &= 36 \\
	\dfrac{12x}{10} &= 36 \\
	12x &= 360 \\
	x &= 360/12 \\
	&= 30
\end{aligned}
$$

When we increase a number ${x}$ by some percentage, we add the percent of
${x}$ to ${x}$ itself. For example, if we increase 100 by ${1\%}$, we
increase 100 by 1, since ${1\%}$ of 100 is 1 &mdash; 101. Likewise, if we
increase 100 by ${100\%,}$ we obtain 200, since ${100\%}$ of 100 is 100
${(100 + 100 = 200.)}$

## Proportions

Suppose there is a ratio of two variable quantities. If this ratio is
always the same, we say the two quantities are in **direct proportion**.
For example, suppose ${x = 5}$ and ${y = 9.}$ Now suppose that ${x}$ and
${y}$ are directly proportional. What is ${y}$ when ${x = 14?}$ Since ${x}$
and ${y}$ are directly proportional:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\dfrac{x}{y} &= \dfrac{5}{9} \\
	\dfrac{5}{9} &= \dfrac{14}{y} \\
	9(14) &= 5y \\
	126 &= 5y \\
	y &= 126/5 = 25.2 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Another example: Suppose ${a}$ and ${b^2}$ are directly proportional,
${a = 5,}$ and ${b = 9.}$ What is ${a}$ when ${b = 12?}$ Since ${a}$ and
${b^2}$ are directly proportional:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\dfrac{a}{b^2} &= \dfrac{5}{(9)^2} \\
	&= \dfrac{5}{81} \\
	\dfrac{5}{81} &= \dfrac{a}{(12)^2} \\
	81a &= 5(12)(12) \\
	(3)(3)(3)(3) a &= 5(3)(4)(3)(4) \\
	\cancel{(3)}\cancel{(3)}(3)(3) a &= 5\cancel{(3)}(4)\cancel{(3)}(4) \\
	9a &= 80 \\
	a &= 80/9
\end{aligned}
$$
