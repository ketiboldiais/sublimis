# The Domain of an Expression

All mathematical expressions have a domain &mdash; the set of all values
for which the expression is defined. Less formally, the domain of an
expression is essentially the boundaries of what we're discussing. For
example, if we were debating the costs and benefits of capitalism, the
debate might be limited to economies that exist today, rather than the
economies of ancient Egypt. The basic idea is that, outside of the domain,
the expression is undefined &mdash; all bets are off.

For example, the expression $3x + 4$ has a domain of $\mathbb{R}$, since it
is defined for all real numbers. We denote the domain of $3x + 4$ with the
notation: $dom(3x + 4) = \mathbb{R}$.

Example: What is the domain of $\dfrac{1}{(t-1)(t+3)}$?

$$
\text{dom}\left(\dfrac{1}{(t-1)(t+3)}\right) = \{t \in \mathbb{R} \mid t \neq 1, t \neq
-3\}
$$

We impose restrictions on the domain, since $t = 1$ and $t = -3$ lead to
the denominator evaluating to 0, which is undefined.

For example, what is the domain of $4x + 3x^{-1}$?

$$
\text{dom}\left(4x + \dfrac{3}{x}\right) = \{ \mathbb{R} \mid x \neq 0 \}
$$
