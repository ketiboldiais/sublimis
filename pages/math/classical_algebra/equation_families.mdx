# Families of Equations

Equations fall into several types. Mathematicians have constructed these
groupings because equations often share many properties. We will explore
what these properties are carefully, but before doing so, we have some
familiarity of the type names. The overview provided below is strictly
informal. We will provide more formal definitions when we address each type
of equation in turn.

## Linear Equations

The linear equation is the simplest equation. Here are some examples of
linear equations:

- ${12x - 2 = 0}$
- ${19x = 24}$
- ${17x + 4y = z}$
- ${ax + by + nz = g}$

Notice that the number of variables doesn't prevent an equation from being
classified as a linear equation. Indeed, the only requirements for
something to be a linear equation is that each term is either a constant or
the product of a constant and a single variable. If the linear equation
consists of just one variable, we say that the equation is a linear
equation of one-variable. If there are two variables, it's a linear
equation of two-variables, and so on.

Despite their simplicity, linear equations are extremely important in both
pure and applied mathematics. In physics, the distance an object travels,
called displacement, is given by a linear equation: ${s = x_f -
x_i,}$ where
${s}$ is the displacement, ${x_f}$ is the final position, and ${x_i}$ is
the initial position. The final velocity of an object can also be
determined by the equation ${v_f = v_0 + at,}$ where ${v_f}$ is the final
velocity, ${v_0}$ is the initial velocity, ${a}$ is the acceleration, and
${t}$ is the time interval. These are both linear equations.

## Polynomial Equations

Polynomial equations are equations consisting of polynomials &mdash;
expressions that consist of variables and coefficients where the
onperations involved are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
non-negative integer exponentiation. This is a bit of a mouthful, so here
are some examples of polynomial expressions:

- ${x^2 - 4x + 13}$
- ${x^2 + y^2}$
- ${bx^3}$
- ${2x}$

and here are some examples of polynomial equations:

- ${a^2 + b^2 = c^2}$
- ${\Delta x = v_0t + \dfrac{1}{2}at^2}$
- ${3x^2 - 9 = 0}$
- ${2x - 1 = 0}$

Wait a minute. Isn't that ${2x - 1 = 0}$ a linear equation? It is in fact a
linear equation. All linear equations are polynomial equations of degree-1.
But, not every polynomial equation is a linear equation. For example, a
polynomial equation of degree-2:

$$
	ax^2 + x + c = 0
$$

Put simply, the degree of a polynomial equation is the leading exponent in
the equation. A polynomial equation of degree-3:

$$
	ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0
$$

Because it's fairly cumbersome to write &#8220;of degree-${n}$&#8221; every
time, we have some special names for certain degrees. A quadratic equation
is a polynomial equation of degree-2. For example:

$$
	3x^2 + x - 9 = 0
$$

A cubic equation is a polynomial equation of degree-3:

$$
	4x^3 - x = 12
$$

A quartic equation is a polynomial equation of degree-4:

$$
	x^4 + 3x^3 - 9x^2 + 12 = 0
$$

Quartic equations are sometimes called biquadratic equations. We use the
term quartic because it's shorter to write.

Polynomial equations are also classified by the number of terms the
equation contains. A polynomial equation with only one term is called a
monomial. For example, ${x^2 = 0}$ is a monomial equation. A polynomial
equation with two terms is called a binomial. For example,
${a^2 + b^2 = 2}$ is a binomial equation. A polynomial equation with three
terms is called a trinomial &mdash; ${a^2 + b + c = 0.}$

## Trigonometric Equations

Many equations represent cycles, and wherever there are cycles, there's
likely a trigonometric operator involved. Such equations are called
trigonometric equations. These equations might look something like:

- ${\sin x + \cos y = z}$
- ${(\tan^2 x + 5) - \sin x = 0}$
- ${\arctan z - y^2 = x}$

## Exponential Equations

Exponential equations look very much like polynomials, with the distinctive
feature that their exponents have variables instead. For example:

- ${y = e^x}$
- ${z = y^x - 24}$
- ${2^a + c = b^2}$

Exponential equations are often seen in mathematical models for population
growth and areas of finance.

## Radical Equations

Radical equations have the distinctive feature of containing one or more
radicands or fractional exponents:

- ${y = \sqrt{x}}$
- ${a = b^{1/2}}$

## Rational Equations

Finally, we have the rational equations. These are equations with rational
expressions or negative exponents:

- ${\dfrac{x}{4} = \dfrac{(y - 3)^2}{17}}$
- ${y = \dfrac{1}{x}}$
- ${f = n^{-1}}$
