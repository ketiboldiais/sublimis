# Distributivity

With the rules thus far, we can make even further inferences. We know that
if ${ a + b = 0 }$, then ${ a = -b }$ and ${ b = -a }$. Thus, if
${ a + b = 0 }$, then it must be true that ${ (a + b) + (-a - b) = 0 }$,
since ${ a + b = 0 }$ and ${ -a - b = 0 }$. If ${ (a + b) + (-a-b) = 0 }$,
then it follows that ${ a + b - a -b = 0 }$. Rearranging the equation, we
have ${ a - a + b - b = 0 }$. Rearranging again, we have:
${ -(a + b) = -a + (-b) }$. This yields the following inference:

$$
-(a + b) = -a - b
$$

Note that we should always be vigilant about distributing a minus sign to a
sum involving negative numbers: ${ -(-a) = a }$. To ensure that vigilance,
we should make the following rules clear:

> _Lemma_. If ${ a }$ and ${ b }$ are positive integers, then ${ a + b }$
> is a positive integer.

> _Lemma_. If ${ a }$ and ${ b }$ are negative integers, then ${ a + b }$
> is a negative integer.

We can see that these rules are true with a simple proof. Let ${ a = -n }$
and ${ b = -m }$, where ${ m }$ and ${ n }$ are positive. It follows then
that ${ a + b = -n - m = -(n + m) }$. Since ${ n }$ and ${ m }$ are
positive, ${ n + m }$ is positive. Since ${ n + m }$ is positive, it
follows that ${ a + b }$ is negative, because ${ n + m }$ is positive only
if ${ a + b }$ is negative.

This analysis hints at another law, the **distributive property.** Stated
formally:

> _Distributive Property_. If ${a, b, c \in \R,}$ then:
> ${a(b + c) = ab + ac}$

With the distribute property, we have another way of proving that
${a \cdot 0 = 0:}$

$$
\begin{aligned} (a \cdot 0) + (a \cdot 0) &= a \cdot (0 + 0) \\ &= a
\cdot 0 \end{aligned}
$$

The distributive property is also what leads to what at first appears to be
a mysterious rule: The product of two negative numbers is a positive
number. First, we start by proving that ${(-a)(b) = -(a \cdot b):}$

$$
\begin{aligned} (-a)(b) + (a)(b) &= ((-a) + a)(b) \\ &= (0)(b) \\ &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Because ${(-a)(b) = -(a \cdot b),}$ we can make the following inferences.
First, the factor ${(-a)(b) = -(ab).}$ Adding ${-(ab)}$ to both sides:

$$
\begin{aligned} (-a)(-b) + (-(ab)) &= (-a)(-b) + (-ab) \\ &= (-a) \cdot
((-b) + b) \\ &= (-a) \cdot 0 \\ &= 0 \end{aligned}
$$

Adding ${(a)(b)}$ to both sides:

$$
(-a)(-b) = (a)(b)
$$

Multiplying ${37 \cdot 25 \cdot 4,}$ we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	37 \cdot 25 \cdot 4 &= 37 \cdot (25 \cdot 4)
	&= 37 \cdot (100) \\
	&= 3700 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Anoter example: Multiply ${125 \cdot 37 \cdot 8}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
	125 \cdot 37 \cdot 8 = (25 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 2) \cdot 37 \\
	= (100 \cdot 10) \cdot 37 \\
	= (1000) \cdot 37 \\
	= 37000
\end{aligned}
$$

## Multiplication Algorithm
The law of distributivity is what leads to the
multiplication algorithm we're all farmiliar with from elementary school.
The multiplication algorithm allows us to compute large numbers without the
need for memorization. For example, ${17 \times 38}$:

$$
\begin{array}{cc} & \space & 1 & 7 & \\ & \times & 3 & 8 & \\ \hline &
1 & 3 & 6 & \\ + & 5 & 1 \\ \hline & 6 & 4 & 6 & \end{array}
$$

Similarly:

$$
\begin{array}{cc} & \space & 3 & 8 & \\ & \times & 1 & 7 & \\ \hline &
2 & 6 & 6 & \\ + & 3 & 8 \\ \hline & 6 & 4 & 6 & \end{array}
$$

The algorithm above is really an embodiment of applying the distributive
property:

$$
\begin{aligned} 17 \times 38 &= 17 \times (3 \times 10 + 8) \\ &= (17
\times 3 \times 10) + (17 \times 8) \\ &= 510 + 136 \\ &= 646
\end{aligned}
$$
