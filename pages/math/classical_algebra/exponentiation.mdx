# Exponentiation

We can get by with the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division alone. However, having just these operations would be
particularly cumbersome for many mathematical statements. Consider for
example, the following expression:

$$
xxxxxxx + xxx
$$

This is difficult to parse, and delimiting with parentheses and operator
symbols is no better:

$$
(x)(x)(x)(x)(x)(x)(x) + (x)(x)(x)
$$

$$
x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x + x \cdot x \cdot x
$$

Even worse:[^zenzizezic]

$$
xxxxxxx \times xxx = xxxxxxxxxx
$$

[^zenzizenzic] As an aside, the eighth power of a number is called
zenzizenzizenzic. Coined by the 16th century Welsh physician Robert
Recorde, the root of the word is "zenzic," The German spelling of the Latin
"censo," meaning "squared." At the time, there was no easy way to denote
powers of numbers, so various forms of "zenzic" were used: zenzic for
squared, zenzizenzic for the square of a square, and zenzizenzizenzic for
the square of a square of a square.

Because of this difficulty, we have the special operation of
**exponentiation**. We can think of this as repeated multiplication. And
because multiplication is already a pretty fast way of counting,
exponentiation is even faster.

$$
xxxxxxx + xxx = x^7 + x^3
$$

$$
xxxxxxx \times xxx = x^7 \times x^3 = x^{10}
$$

From the multiplication example, we have the following rule:

> _Product Rule of Exponents_. For any ${a \in \R,}$ given ${m \in \N}$ and
> ${n \in \N:}$ ${a^m a^n = a^{m + n}}$

Now, consider the following:

$$
\dfrac{a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot a}{a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot a} =
\dfrac{a^4}{a^5}
$$

Really, this reduces to:

$$
\dfrac{\cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot
\cancel{a}}{\cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot
\cancel{a} \cdot a} = \dfrac{1}{a}
$$

The computation above provides us this rule:

> _The Quotient Rule of Exponents_. For any ${a \in \R,}$ and
> ${m \in \N,}$ > ${n \in \N,}$ such that ${m > n,}$ >
> ${\dfrac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m - n}}$

and this rule:

> _The Negative Rule of Exponents_. For any ${a \in \R,}$ and
> ${n \in \N,}$ > ${a^{-n} = \dfrac{1}{a^n}}$

From the **Quotient Rule of Exponents**, we can observe:

$$\dfrac{a \cdot a \cdot a}{a \cdot a \cdot a} = \dfrac{a^3}{a^3}$$

$$
\dfrac{\cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a}}{\cancel{a} \cdot
\cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a}} = a^{3-3}
$$

$$\phantom{\dfrac{a \cdot a \cdot a}{a \cdot a \cdot a}} = a^0$$
$$\phantom{\dfrac{a \cdot a \cdot a}{a \cdot a \cdot a}} = 1$$

Thus, we have the rule:

> _The Zero Exponent Rule_. For any ${\{a \in \R : a \neq 0 \},}$ >
> ${a^0 = 1.}$

The **Zero Exponent Rule** as applied to the number ${0}$ &mdash; ${0^0}$
&mdash; is a point of debate. Some mathematicians treat 0 as ${0^0 = 1.}$
In algebra and calculus, however, ${0^0 \implies \text{undefined}.}$ In
computer science, programming languages handle ${0^0}$ in numerous
different ways; some languages provide an explicit value (i.e., 1), others
undefined, others return an error.

Each approach has valid premises. If you consider ${x^y}$ as a function of
two variables, then we have a problem with the definition ${0^0 = 1.}$ If
we approach 0 along the line ${y = 0,}$ then following the definition,
${\lim\limits_{x \to 0^{+}} = 1.}$ However, if we approach 0 along the line
${x = 0,}$ then we get
${\lim\limits_{y \to 0^{y}} = \lim\limits_{y \to 0^{+}}0 = 0.}$ This would
mean ${0^0 = 0.}$ Thus, continuous mathematics generally treats
${0^0 \implies \text{undefined}.}$

On the other hand, discrete mathematics treats ${0^0 = 1.}$ In set theory,
${A^B}$ denotes the set of all functions from ${B}$ to ${A.}$ If ${A}$ and
${B}$ denote the cardinalities (i.e., the "size" of the sets) then ${A^B}$
is the size of the set of all functions from ${A}$ to ${B.}$ If we use the
value 0 for ${A}$ and ${B,}$ then 0 denotes the empty set &mdash; ${0^0}$
is the collection of all functions from the empty set to the empty set.
This is the **empty function**. There is one, and only one, empty function.
Accordingly, ${0^0 = 1.}$ Thus, it must be true that ${0^0 = 1.}$

In these materials, we will limit the _Zero Exponent Rule_ to a number
${x}$ where ${\{ x \in \R : x \neq 0 \}.}$ Next, consider the following
example:

$$(b^3)^2$$

This expression captures:

$$(b \cdot b \cdot b ) \cdot (b \cdot b \cdot b)$$

Following the associative property of multiplication:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	(b \cdot b \cdot b ) \cdot (b \cdot b \cdot b) &= b \cdot b \cdot b \cdot b \cdot b \cdot b \\
	& = b^6
\end{aligned}
$$

Again, we have another rule:

> _The Power Rule of Exponents_. For any ${a \in \R,}$ and ${m \in \N,}$ >
> ${n \in \N,}$ ${(a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}}$

Using the commutative and associative properties of multiplication yields
another inference:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	(ab)^3 &= (ab) \cdot (ab) \cdot (ab) ~\text{expansion} \\
	&= a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot b \cdot b \cdot b ~\text{by associativity} \\
	&= (a \cdot a \cdot a) \cdot (b \cdot b \cdot b) ~\text{by commutativity} \\
	&= a^{3}b^{3} ~\text{by the Definition of Exponent}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, it follows that:

> _The Power of a Product Rule of Exponents._ For all ${a, b \in \R,}$
> given a ${n \in \N,}$ ${(ab)^n = a^n b^n}$

This rule leads to another rule. Consider the expression
${(a^{-2}b^{2})^3.}$ Expanding and reducing this expression with the
negative rule of exponents, we get:

$$
	(a^{-2}b^{2})^3 = \left(\dfrac{b^2}{a^2}\right)^3
$$

Applyting the definition of an exponent:

$$
(a^{-2}b^{2})^3 = \left(\dfrac{b^2}{a^2}\right) \cdot
\left(\dfrac{b^2}{a^2}\right) \cdot \left(\dfrac{b^2}{a^2}\right)
$$

Then by commutativity:

$$
(a^{-2}b^{2})^3 = \dfrac{b^2 \cdot b^2 \cdot b^2}{a^2
\cdot a^2 \cdot a^2}
$$

And by the product rule of exponents:

$$
(a^{-2}b^{2})^3 = \dfrac{b^6}{a^6}}
$$

Finally, by the negative rule of exponents:

$$
\phantom{(a^{-2}b^{2})^3} = a^{-6}b^{6}
$$

This yields the rule:

> _The Power of a Quotient Rule of Exponents._ For all ${a, b \in \R}$ and
> any ${n \in \Z,}$ $$\left( \dfrac{a}{b} \right)^n = \dfrac{a^n}{b^n}$$
