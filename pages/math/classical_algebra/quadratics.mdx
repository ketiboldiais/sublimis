# Quadratic Equations

Quadratic equations are equations in one variable that can be written in
the form:

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$

If we seek to determine the the truth set of a quadratic equation (i.e.,
the set of all roots, or values of ${x}$ where the equation is true), our
first course of action is to factor. And whenever we factor, we should be
cognizant of the basic law of multiplication:

$$
pq = 0 \iff \begin{cases} p = 0, \text{ or } \\ q = 0, \text{ or } \\ p
= 0 \text{ and } q = 0 \end{cases}
$$

> Example: What is the value of ${x}$ in ${ 8x^2 - 3 = 10x?}$

Subtracting ${10x}$ from both sides, we get:

$$
	8x^x - 10x - 3 = 0
$$

Factoring:

$$
	(2x + 3)(4x + 1) = 0
$$

Solving for ${x}$ for one of the expressions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	2x + 3 &= 0 \\
	2x &= -3 \\
	x &= \frac{-3}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

And for the other expression:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	4x + 1 &= 0 \\
	4x &= -1 \\
	x &= \frac{-1}{4} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, we have:

$$
	x = \frac{-3}{2}, \frac{-1}{4}
$$
