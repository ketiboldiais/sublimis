# Conditional Equations

The opposite of an identity is a conditional equation. These are equations
that are true only if some condition(s) is/are true. For example, the
following are conditional equations:

- ${2x = 10}$
- ${x = x + 1}$

The equation $2x = 10$ is true only if it is true that $x = 5$. The
equation $x = x + 1$ is true only if there is some number that equals one
more than itself (a condition that can never be satisfied, so the equation
can never be true).

## Equivalent Equations

Equivalent expressions are represented by expressions. Equations themselves
can be equivalent. Two equations are equivalent if, and only if, they have
exactly the same solutions.
