# Real Numbers

$$
\{ 1, 3.14, \pi, \phi, e, 4, 8 \}
$$

All of the numbers above are called **real numbers**. In the simplest
terms, a real number is a number that can be written as a decimal. Thus, 7
is a real number, since ${7 = 7.0.}$ Similarly, while ${\pi}$ is an
irrational number. It is a real number since it can be written as a decimal
(${3.14 \ldots}$), albeit non-terminating.
