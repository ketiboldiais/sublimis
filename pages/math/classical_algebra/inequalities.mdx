# Inequalities

Inequalities arguably appear more often than equalities in mathematics.
This is because equality imposes an extraordinarily high burden of proof:
When we write ${a = b,}$ we are implying that ${a}$ and ${b}$ are the same
in every possible way. Because of that burden, we often must speak in terms
of relativity, using the symbols
${ <, >, \leq, \geq, \nless, \ngtr, \nleq, \ngeq.}$ Let's discuss how each
of these symbols are used and the propositions they can express.

First, when we write ${a < b,}$ we are stating, ${a}$ is greater than
${b.}$\_ The same proposition can be written as ${b < a.}$

Second, if ${a < 0,}$ we say that ${a}$ is **negative**. If ${a > 0,}$ we
say that ${a}$ is **positive**.

Third, the inequality symbols operate similarly to the equal sign: There
are two sides, and we can manipulate the expression accordingly &mdash; so
long as the expression remains true. For example, consider the proposition
${a > b.}$ We can manipulate this expression as such:

$$
	\begin{aligned} a &> b \\ a - b &> b - b \\ a - b &> 0 \end{aligned}
$$

We see that given the expression ${a > b,}$ it follows that ${a - b}$ is
positive. This analysis leads to several laws. First, the **Trichotomy
law**:

> _Trichotomy Law_. For every ${a \in \R,}$ one, and only one, of the
> following propositions is true: ${a = 0}$ ${a \in \R^{+}}$ >
> ${-a \in \R^{+}}$

The rule above tells us that every real number ${a}$ can be only one of
three things: zero, positive, or negative. Those are the only three
possible states. Nothing else. Additionally, we have the **laws of
closure**. We can think of these laws as defining the boundaries of
addition and multiplication. First, the **law of closure under addition**:

> _Closure Under Addition._ If ${a}$ and ${b}$ are in ${R^{+},}$ then
> ${a + b}$ is in ${R^{+}.}$

And the **law of closure under multiplication**:

> _Closure Under Multiplication._ If ${a}$ and ${b}$ are in ${R^{+},}$ then
> ${a \cdot b}$ is in ${R^{+}.}$

Complementing the laws above, we have the following definitions:

> _Definition._ Given any two numbers ${a}$ and ${b,}$ the following
> propositions hold:
>
> 1. ${a - b \in \R^{+} \implies a > b}$
> 2. ${b > a \implies a}$
> 3. ${(a > b) \lor (a = b) \implies a \geq b}$
> 4. ${a > 0 \iff a \in \R^{+}}$

As a consequence of the definitions above, we have:

> _Definition_. Given any two numbers ${a}$ and ${b,}$ exactly one of the
> following propositions is true:
> * ${a - b = 0,}$ 
> * ${a - b > 0,}$ xor
> * ${-(a - b) = b - a > 0}$

Manipulating the above definitions, we have:

> Definition. Given any two numbers ${a}$ and ${b,}$ exactly one of the
> following propositions is true: ${a = b,}$ ${a > b,}$ xor ${b > a}$

That is to say, given any numbers ${a}$ and ${b,}$ one is less than or
equal to the other.
