# Expanding Binomials: The Binomial Theorem

Recall that a binomial is a polynomial consisting of the sum of two
monomials. In other words, a polynomial with two terms. For example, the
expression:

$$
	ax^m - bx^n
$$

is a binomial, where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are numbers, ${m}$ and ${n}$ are
distinct, nonnegative integers, and ${x}$ is a variable (or more formally,
the indeterminate). Taking higher powers of binomials and expanding them is
a process that quickly grows tedious. To see how, let's consider a few
examples.

First, let's expand ${(a + b)^0.}$ This is straightforward; it's just
${1:}$

$$
	(a + b)^0 = 1
$$

Similarly, ${(a + b)^1}$ isn't so bad either:

$$
	(a + b)^1 = a + b
$$

$(a + b)^2$ isn't terrible if we know our expansions by heart:

$$
	(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
$$

How about ${(a + b)^3}$? Well, we can carry it out:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		(a + b)^3 &= (a + b)(a + b)(a + b) \\ &= (a + b)(a^2 +
		2ab + b^2) \\ &= a^3 + 2a^2b + ab^2 + a^2b + 2ab^2 + b^3 \\ &= a^3 + 3a^2b +
		3ab^2 + b^3
	\end{aligned}
$$

And ${(a + b)^4:}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
	(a + b)^4 &= (a + b)(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3) \\ &= a(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3) + b(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3)\\ &= a^4 + 3a^3b
	+ 3a^2b^2 + ab^3 + a^3b + 3a^2b^2 + 3ab^3 + b^4 \\ &= a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice how these expressions are getting more and more tedious. Laying out
the expansions in a table:

| expression    | expansion                                           | term count |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| ${(a + b)^0}$ | 1                                                   | 1          |
| ${(a + b)^1}$ | ${a + b}$                                           | 2          |
| ${(a + b)^2}$ | ${a^2 + 2ab + b^2}$                                 | 3          |
| ${(a + b)^3}$ | ${a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3}$                       | 4          |
| ${(a + b)^4}$ | ${a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4}$             | 5          |
| ${(a + b)^5}$ | ${a^5 + 5a^4b + 10a^3b^2 + 10a^2b^3 + 5ab^4 + b^5}$ | 6          |

Needless to say, expanding binomials with higher powers by hand is tedious
and prone to error. Attempting to expand something like ${(a + b)^{100}}$
would take a very, very long time. And then after we're done, we must still
go through the process of checking if our algebraic manipulation is
correct.

Fortunately, there's a theorem to make our lives easier. But, before we
examine this theorem, let's segue briefly into the world of counting.

# The Factorial

A common operation in counting is the factorial. It is defined as follows:

> _Definition: Factorial_. Let ${n}$ be a positive integer. Then ${n!,}$
> read ${n}$ factorial, is denoted:
>
> $$
> 	n! = n \cdot (n - 1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \ldots \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1
> $$

Alongside the definition above is the following axiom:

> _Axiom: Zero Factorial_. The factorial of zero is one: $$ 0! = 1 $$

To illustrate, ${6!}$ is computed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
6! &= (6)(6-1)(6-2)(6-3)(6-4)(6-5)\\[1em]
&= (6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1) \\[1em]
&= (6)(5)(2)(4)(3) \\[1em]
&= (6)(10)(12) \\[1em]
&= (6)(120) \\[1em]
&= 720
\end{aligned}
$$

## Binomial Coefficients

Suppose we had the following balls:

Our friend Leibniz comes up to us and says, Pick ${1.}$ How many possible
choices do we have? Well, we would have ${4}$ possible choices: A, B, C,
and D. Now what if Leibniz said, Pick ${2.}$ How many choices do we have
here? Well, we can count the number of possible choices: AB, AC, AD, BC,
BD, CD. These are six possible choices. In fact, we can layout these
possibilities:

Choose Possibilities Number of Possibilities

In mathematics, we have special syntax for expressing our thought process
above. When Leibniz says, Pick 1, we express this as:

$$
	\dbinom{4}{1}
$$

This notation is read "Four choose one." There are four balls, and we are
to pick one. When Leibniz says, Pick 2, we write this as:

$$
	\dbinom{4}{2}
$$

"Four choose two." And when Leibniz says, Pick 3, we have:

$$
	\dbinom{4}{3}
$$

"Four choose three." The notation ${\dbinom{n}{k}}$ is called a _binomial
coefficient_, and it is read as ${n}$ choose ${k.}$ Formally:

> Definition: Binomial Coefficient. For nonnegative integers ${n}$ and
> ${k,}$ where ${n \geq k,}$ the expression ${\binom{n}{k},}$ also written
> as ${_cC_k,}$ is called a binomial coefficient, and it is defined as:
>
> $$
> 	\dbinom{n}{k} = \dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}
> $$
>
> Otherwise, where ${k > n,}$ the binomial coefficient is defined as:
>
> $$
> 	\dbinom{n}{k} = 0
> $$

To understand where the binomial coefficient comes from, it's helpful to
illustrate by example. Suppose we had the following ingredients for a cup
of coffeee: coffee, milk, sugar. Now suppose we were asked, how many
possible ways are there to make a cup of sweet coffee? Well, we can
enumerate the number of ways with a table (where ${c}$ is for coffee, ${m}$
is for milk, and ${s}$ is for sugar):

| pick | possible picks         | number of possibilities |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 0    | 1                      |
| 1    | A, B, C, D             | 4                       |
| 2    | AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD | 6                       |
| 3    | ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD     | 4                       |
| 4    | ABCD                   | 1                       |

Reading the table above, we count six different orders. For example,
${(c, m, s)}$ is coffee, then milk, then sugar, and ${(s,m,c)}$ is sugar,
then milk, then coffee. This result follows directly from the
multiplication rule in counting. Since we have three different ingredients,
the number of recipes is yielded by:

$$
	3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
$$

Generalizing the multiplication rule, given ${n}$ ingredients and ${k}$
choices, we have:

$$
	n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2) \ldots \times (n - k + 1) = \dfrac{n!}{(n - k)!}
$$

Importantly, the question of how many different recipes there are is
distinct from asking: How many combinations of coffee, sugar, and milk are
there? The former requires a distinct order, while the latter does not. The
latter question &mdash; how many different combinations are there
(disregarding order) &mdash; is what the binomial coefficient attempts to
capture.

Hence, using our sweet coffee example, when write ${\dbinom{3}{2},}$ we are
expressing the number of combinations of two ingredients among three, where
order does not matter. If we enumerated all of the possibilities out on a
table:

Counting the number of possibilities, we have ${6.}$ But because we're
disregarding order, the table above is incorrect because we've overcounted.
Some of the possibilities are duplicated. As such, we must eliminate the
duplicates:

| ingredient | combination | combination |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| ${c}$      | ${(c, m)}$  | ${(c, s)}$  |
| ${m}$      | ${(m, c)}$  | ${(m, s)}$  |
| ${s}$      | ${(s, c)}$  | ${(s, m)}$  |

Notice that eliminating the overcount leaves us with three possibilities.
Further notice that this is half of our original count. This is no
coincidence. Looking back at our general formula for the multiplication
rule, we can see that eliminating the overcount is a matter of dividing by
a ${k!}$ term (since we've overcounted by a factor of ${k!}$):

$$
\begin{aligned} n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2) \ldots \times (n - k +
1) &= \dfrac{n!}{(n - k)!} \\[2em] \dfrac{n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2)
\ldots \times (n - k + 1)}{k!} &= \dfrac{\dfrac{n!}{(n - k)!}}{k!} \\[2em]
&= \dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \end{aligned}
$$

And there it is &mdash; the binomial coefficient definition.

## Pascal's Triangle

Do we notice any patterns in this triangle? There are several. The Binomial
Theorem This is where the binomial theorem comes in handy:

> _Binomial Theorem_. For any positive integer ${n,}$ the following is
> true:
>
> $$
> \begin{aligned} (a + b)^n &= \sum\limits_{k = 0}^{n} \dbinom{n}{k}
> a^{n - k}b^k \\[2em] &= \dbinom{n}{0}a^n + \dbinom{n}{1}a^{n - 1}b +
> \dbinom{n}{2}a^{n-2}b^2 + \ldots + \dbinom{n}{n}b^n \end{aligned}
> $$
