# Linear Equations in One Variable

Because equations often share properties, they can be classified into
various kinds. One such kind is a linear equation in one variable.

> _Definition_. A linear equation in one variable is an equation that can
> be written in the form:
>
> $$
> ax + b = 0
> $$
>
> where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and ${a \neq 0.}$

For example, all of the equations below are one-variable linear equations:

- ${5x = 10}$
- ${2m + 3 = 19}$
- ${\dfrac{y}{3} = \dfrac{y}{5} + 1}$
