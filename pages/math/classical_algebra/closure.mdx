# Closure

Even without a sophisticated understanding of number theory, we know that
adding a whole number to a whole number always returns a whole number.
E.g., ${1 + 1 = 2,}$ ${2 + 5 = 7,}$ ${1132+ 324 = 1456.}$ Formally, we call
this phenomenon the **closure property**.

> _Property_. Let ${a, b \in \N}$ then ${a + b \in \N}$ >
> ${a \cdot b \in \N}$

From the property above, we say that the natural numbers are _closed_ under
addition and multiplication. In other words, if we add two natural numbers,
then the sum is a natural number. If we multiply two natural numbers, then
the product is natural number.

From the property above, we can draw a few other useful properties. First,
because we define the natural numbers as including 0, the set of natural
numbers is a superset of the positive integers. Accordingly:

> _Corollary_. Let ${a, b \in \N}$ then: ${a + b \in \Z^{+}}$ >
> ${a \cdot b \in \Z^{+}}$

In other words, the set of positive integers is closed under addition and
multiplication. If we add two positive integers, then the sum is a positive
integer. If we multiply two positive integers, then the product is a
positive integer.[^closurenatnum]

[^closurenatnum] Note that the natural numbers' closure property applies
only to addition and multiplication. It does not apply to division and
subtraction.
