# Addition

Addition can be thought of as moving to the right along the real number
line by whatever number we are adding. So, for example, the expression
${4 + 2}$ can be thought of as "Start at 4, and move 2 to the right." This
give us the final destination of 6. Subtraction is really just addition,
only instead of moving towards the right, we move towards the left. For
example, $4 - 3$ is really $4 + (-3)$, returning 1. Visually:

## Identity Property of Addition

Pius, a bank robber, goes to Ultimate Safety Bank, and robs it. He leaves
with 4,000 dollars. Pius then goes to another bank Safer Bank, 4,000
dollars and fake gun in hand, and tells the teller to put the money in the
bag. The teller takes the bag, disappears below the counter, and pretends
to place money in the bag; the teller, in fact, didn't place anything in
the bag. She returns the bag, and Pius sprints out the building to his
e-scooter, and zooms away. He gets home and opens the bag. How much money
does Pius have?

Pius starts with 0, then takes 4,000 from Ultimate Safety, then goes to
Safer Bank, and gets 0. When we add 0 to a number, we are effectively
saying "no movement" along the number line. Thus, we have the following
rule:

> _Identity Property of Addition_. Given ${a \in \R,}$ then:
>
> $$
> a + 0 = 0 + a = a
> $$

## Subtraction

Knowing whether operands are negative or positive can allow us to
immediately conclude certain propositions. First, the sum of two positive
integers is a positive integer.

> _Property_. If ${a, b \in \Z^{+},}$ then ${a + b \in \Z^{+}.}$

From the rule property above, we have a further property: The sum of two
negative numbers is a negative number.

> _Definition_. If ${a, b \in \Z^{-},}$ then ${a + b \in \Z^{-}.}$

The operation of subtraction is not exactly an independent operation.
Really, subtraction is just addition with a negative. The "operation" of
subtraction is really just a shorthand way for writing out addition of
positive and negative numbers. For example, when we write ${a + (-b),}$< we
instead just write ${a - b.}$ It's just a faster way of writing the same
expression.

The identity property of addition leads to the additive inverse. As
aforementioned, subtraction is really just adding negative numbers.
Considering the addition with zero rule, we have the following inference:

> _Additive Inverse_. Given ${a \in \R,}$ ${a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0}$

Given the equation ${a + (-a) = 0}$, we say that ${-a}$ is the additive
inverse of ${a.}$ Whenever we see the equation ${-a + a = 0}$, we should
immediately become aware that we ${a}$ and ${-a}$ are on opposite sides of
0 on the real line. Furthermore, because ${-a + a = 0}$, subtracting ${-a}$
from both sides, we have ${-a =
-(-a)}$.

The additive inverse also allows us to draw another inference. Given the
equation ${a + x = a,}$ we should immediately know that ${x = 0.}$
Similary, if we see the equation ${a + x = 0,}$ then we should immediately
know that ${x = -a.}$

## Commutative Property of Addition

The commutative law of addition states that:

$$
a + b = b + a
$$

In other words, the order of the terms in an addition expression does not
change the sum of those terms. We call the property above more generally as
**commutativity**. One way to remember it: In addition, terms can
"commute."" In other words, the terms can move around as they please, as
long as they stay within addition (and as we'll see later, multiplication).

The idea is made apparent from a simple analogy. If we want sweet iced tea,
we can: add the tea, then the ice, then the sugar; or we can add the sugar,
then the ice, then the tea; or we can add the tea, then the sugar, then the
ice, and so on and so forth. Either or, the result is the same &mdash;

[^tea]:
    Granted, greater minds may differ on how sweet iced tea should be made.

## Associative Law of Addition

The associative law of addition states that the sum of the terms does not
depend on the grouping of the terms. In other words, we can group the terms
however way we'd like.

> _Associative Property of Addition._ Given ${a, b, c \in \R,}$ then:
>
> $$
> a + b + c = (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
> $$

We call the property above more generally as _associativity_. We can
remember it as: In addition, the terms are free to _associate_. In other
words, the terms can gather together or separate as they please, as long as
they stay within addition (and again, as we'll see later, multiplication).

From the definition above, if we have the expression ${a + b + c + d,}$ we
can generate numerous different possibilities:

$$
a + b + c + d \\
a + b + c + d \\
a + (b + c + d) \\
a + (b + (c + d)) \\
a + b + (c + d)
$$

All these possibilities are equivalent, but some may be easier to compute
than others. The associative law of addition leads to another useful
property:

> _Lemma._ If $a + b = 0$, then $b = -a$ and $a = -b$.

The above property is the direct result of subtracting either $a$ or $b$
from both sides. Associativity and commutativity are what allow us to
rewrite expressions in numerous different ways:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(a - b) + c &= (a + (-b)) + c \\
&= a + (-b + c) ~\text{by associativity} \\
&= a + (c - b) ~\text{by commutativity} \\
&= (a + c) - b ~\text{by associativity}
\end{aligned}
$$

Importantly, the associative property of addition does not apply to
subtraction. For example, ${a - b}$ does not imply that ${b - a.}$
${a - b}$ is equivalent to ${a + (-b),}$ but it is not equivalent to
${b + (-a).}$ The proposition ${a - b = b - a}$ is true iff ${a = b.}$

## Even-Odd Signage Rule

Given that $a + (-a) = 0$, we can draw yet another inference:

$$
a = -(-a)
$$

Notice that the number of minus signs is even. If we add another minus
sign:

$$
-(-(-a)) = -(a) = -a
$$

Thus, we can make yet another inference:

> _Lemma_. Let $a$ be a positive real number, and $x$ be $a$ preceded by
> $n$ minus signs, where $n$ is an integer. If $n$ is even, then $x$ is
> positive (i.e., $a$). If $n$ is odd, then $x$ is negative (i.e., $-a$).

The even-odd signage rule really can be thought of as the arithmetic
equivalent of double-negatives. The rule is what allows us to rewrite
expressions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	-(a + b) &= - a - b \\
	a + b &= - (- a - b)
\end{aligned}
$$

## The Cancellation Law of Addition

The Cancellation Law for Addition Suppose we have the following
relationship:

$$
a + b = a + c
$$

Subtracting ${ a }$ from both sides, we have ${ a + b - a = a + c - a }$.
Simplifying, we have: ${ b = c }$. This inference is called the
**cancellation law for addition**.

> _Cancellation Law of Addition._ If ${ a + b = a + c }$, then ${ b = c }$.
