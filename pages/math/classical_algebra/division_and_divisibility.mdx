# Division & Divisibility

Of the core arithmetic operators, division is the most complex. In any
discussion of division, we must first begin with two subsets of integers,
the **even integers**:

$$
    \{ 2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots \}
$$

and the odd integers:

$$
    \{1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots\}
$$

Notice that both the even integers and the odd integers increment by 2. The
difference, however, is that the even integers start at 2, and the odd
integers start at 1. A number's property of odd-ness or even-ness is called
the number's **parity**. Note that parity is a property held only by the
positive integers. The negative integers are neither even nor odd. We can
abstract this idea with algebra: An even integer is an integer that can be
written as ${2k,}$ where ${k}$ is a positive integer. Denoting the set of
even integers with the symbol ${\Z_{\text{even}},}$ and the set of positive
integers with the symbol ${\Z_{\text{odd}},}$ we can define an even integer
more formally as:

> Definition. Let ${x \in \Z.}$ >
> ${x \in \Z_{\text{even}} \iff x = 2k : k \in \Z^{+}}$ I.e., an integer
> ${x}$ is even if, and only if, it can be written in the form ${2k,}$
> where ${k}$ is a positive integer.

For the odd integers, we write:

> Definition. Let ${x \in \Z.}$ >
> ${x \in \Z_{\text{odd}} \iff x = 2k - 1 : k \in \Z^{+}}$

I.e., an integer ${x}$ is odd if, and only if, it can be written in the
form ${2k - 1,}$ where ${k}$ is a positive integer. Alternatively, we can
define odd integers as the following:

> Definition. Let ${x \in \Z.}$ >
> ${x \in \Z_{\text{odd}} \iff x = 2k + 1 : k \in \N}$

In other words, an integer ${x}$ is odd if, and only if, it can be written
in the form ${2k + 1,}$ where ${k}$ is a natural number.

The only meaningful difference between the first and second definition is
whether ${k}$ is a natural number or a positive integer. In other words,
whether ${k}$ can be 0. If ${k}$ can be 0, then we must change the
definition from ${2k - 1}$ to ${2k + 1,}$ because if ${k = 0,}$ then
${2k - 1 = -1.}$ ${-1}$ is neither odd nor even, because parity is a
property that applies only to positive integers (0 is also neither odd nor
even).

Knowing the parity of two integers allows us to quickly determine the
parity of their sums:

> _Lemma_. Let ${a, b \in \Z^{+}.}$ Then:
>
> 1. ${a, b \in \Z_{\text{even}} \implies a + b \in \Z_{\text{even}}}$
> 2. ${[(a \in \Z_{\text{even}}) \land (b \in \Z_{\text{odd}})] \implies a - b \in \Z\_{\text{odd}}}$
> 3. ${[(a \in \Z_{\text{odd}}) \land (b \in \Z_{\text{even}})] \implies a - b \in \Z\_{\text{odd}}}$
> 4. ${[(a \in \Z_{\text{odd}}) \land (b \in \Z_{\text{odd}})] \implies a + b \in \Z_{\text{even}}}$

That is, the sum of two even integers is an even integer; the sum of an odd
integer and an even integer is an odd integer; and the sum of two odd
integers is an even integer. From the rule of addition by 0, we also have
the following propositions:

> _Lemma_. Let ${a \in \Z^{+}.}$ Then:
> ${a \in \Z_{\text{even}} \implies a + 0 \in \Z_{\text{even}}}$ >
> ${a \in \Z_{\text{odd}} \implies a + 0 \in \Z_{\text{odd}}}$

Let's prove the first property. First, the hypothesis to be proved:

    Let ${a, b \in \Z^{+}.}$ If ${a \in \Z_{\text{even}}}$ and ${b \in \Z_{\text{even},}}$ then ${a + b \in \Z_{\text{even}}.}$

Because ${a}$ and ${b}$ are even integers, then by definition, ${a}$ and
${b}$ can be written in the forms:

$$
    a = 2n, ~ b = 2m
$$

where ${n, m \in \Z^{+}}$. Thus, by substitution, the expression ${a + b}$
can be written as:

$$
    a + b = 2n + 2m
$$

By distributivity:

$$
    a + b = 2(n + m)
$$

The sum of two positive integers is a positive integer. Accordingly, the
sum of ${n}$ and ${m}$ is some positive integer ${k.}$ As such, the
expression ${2(n + m)}$ can be written as:

$$
    a + b = 2k
$$

Because ${a + b}$ is an expression of the form ${2k,}$ then by definition,
${a + b}$ is even.

Now let's prove the second. Again, we'll use a direct proof. First, the
hypothesis to proved:

> Let ${a,b \in \Z^{+}.}$ If ${a}$ is even and ${b}$ is odd, then ${a + b}$
> is odd.

Suppose ${a}$ is even and ${b}$ is odd. Then by definition, ${a}$ and ${b}$
are positive integers of the form:

$$
    a = 2n, b = 2m + 1
$$

where ${n}$ is a positive integer, and ${m}$ is a natural number. It
follows that:

$$
    a + b = 2n + 2m + 1
$$

Then, by commutativity:

$$
    a + b = (2n + 2m) + 1
$$

And by associativity:

$$
    a + b = 2(n + m) + 1
$$

Given that ${n}$ is a positive integer and ${m}$ is a non-negative integer
(since ${m}$ is a natural number), ${n + m}$ is a natural number.
Accordingly:

$$
    a + b = 2k + 1
$$

where ${k = n + m,}$ which is some natural number. Hence, ${a + b}$ must be
odd, by definition.

Parity provides yet another proposition:

> Lemma. Let ${a \in \Z^{+}.}$ Then
>
> 1. ${a \in \Z_{\text{even}} \implies a^2 \in \Z_{\text{even}}}$
> 2. ${a \in \Z_{\text{odd}} \implies a^2 \in \Z_{\text{odd}}}$

The proposition above tells us that the square of an even integer is even,
and the square of an odd integer is odd. Let's prove it.

The method here is by direct proof. There are two hypotheses to be proved:

1. If ${a}$ is even, then ${a^2}$ is even.
2. If ${a}$ is odd, then ${a^2}$ is odd.

We prove each hypothesis in turn, beginning with the first.

Suppose ${a \in \Z_{\text{even}}.}$ Since ${a}$ is an even integer, then by
definition, ${a}$ is a positive integer of the form ${2n,}$ where ${n}$ is
a positive integer. By substitution:

$$
    a^2 = (2n)^2
$$

Applying the definition of an exponent:

$$
    a^2 = (2n)(2n)
$$

By the associative property of multiplication, we get:

$$
    a^2 = (2)(2 \cdot n \cdot n)
$$

And by the definition of an exponent:

$$
    a^2 = (2)(2n^2)
$$

Because the product of positive integer is a positive integer, the intger
${2n^2}$ is a positive integer. Hence:

$$
    a^2 = 2m
$$

where ${m}$ is a positive integer. Because ${2m}$ is an even integer by
definition, ${a^2}$ is even.

Next, we consider the second hypothesis. Suppose ${a \in
\Z_{\text{odd}}.}$
Given that ${a}$ is an odd integer, then by definition, ${a}$ is a positive
integer of the form ${2n + 1,}$ where ${n}$ is a positive integer. By
substitution:

$$
    a^2 = (2n + 1)^2
$$

By expansion:

$$
    a^2 = 4n^2 + 4n + 1
$$

By associativity:

$$
    a^2 = (4n^2 + 4n) + 1
$$

By distributivity:

$$
    a^2 = 2(2n^2 + 2n) + 1
$$

Because ${n}$ is a positive integer, $$2n^2 + 2n$$ is a positive integer.
Hence:

$$
    a^2 = 2k + 1
$$

where ${k}$ is a positive integer. Because ${2k + 1}$ is an odd integer by
definition, ${a^2}$ is odd. The proposition we've just proven yields a
corollary:

> Corollary. Let ${a \in \Z^{+}.}$ Then:
>
> 1. ${a^2 \in \Z_{\text{even}} \implies a \in \Z_{\text{even}}}$
> 2. ${a^2 \in \Z_{\text{odd}} \implies a \in \Z_{\text{odd}}}$

As with many corollaries, the propositions above are implied by the
previous theorem. If ${a^2}$ is even, then ${a}$ must be even, for if ${a}$
is odd, then ${a^2}$ is odd. Similarly, if ${a^2}$ is odd, then ${a}$ must
be odd, for if ${a}$ is even, then ${a^2}$ is even. This is a
straightforward example of logical contradiction.

## Divisibility

It is from parity that we generalize the concept of **divisibility**.
Suppose ${a}$ is a positive integer and ${b}$ is an integer. When we say
that ${b}$ is divisible by ${a,}$ we mean that ${a}$ divides ${b.}$ We
denote this proposition with the notation ${a \space\vert\space b.}$ An
integer ${b}$ is divisible by ${a}$ if, and only if, ${b = an,}$ where
${n}$ is some integer.

> Definition. Let ${a \in \Z^{+}}$ and ${b \in \Z.}$ Then:
>
> $$
> a \space\vert\space b \iff b = an
> $$
>
> where ${n \in \Z.}$

The definition above yields several useful propositions:

> _Proposition_. Every integer is divisible by 1. Every positive integer is
> divisible by itself.

The first proposition is implied by the fact that every integer can be
written as ${n = (1)(n).}$ This in turn implies the second proposition.

## Composites & Primes

![Compounds and primes along the number line](https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1652645939/math/compound_prime_ifd6hq.svg)

From the definition above, there are two subsets within the natural
numbers. Any natural number that can be grouped into a solid rectangle is
called a **composite number** (also called _compound numbers_). More
formally:

> _Definition_. A _composite number_ ${k}$ is a natural number greater than
> 1, divisible by some positive integer ${n,}$ where ${n \neq 1.}$

The negation of this definition yields the **prime numbers**, numbers that
cannot be grouped into a solid rectangle.

> _Definition_. A _prime number_ ${m}$ is a natural number greater than 1,
> divisible only by 1 and itself.

Note that from the definitions above, we see that the numbers 0 and 1 have
a special property: Both 0 and 1 are neither prime nor compound.

### Division & Rational Numbers

The operation of division is closely tied to the **rational numbers**. A
rational number is any number that can be written in the form:

$$ \dfrac{m}{n} \text{or} m/n $$

where ${m}$ and ${n}$ are integers, and ${n \neq 0.}$ The last condition is
crucial, because in this particular world (classical algebra), we cannot
divide by 0. The rational numbers come in various forms:
${\ldots, \dfrac{1}{3}, - \dfrac{1}{2}, \dfrac{2}{3}, 1.4, 0.08, 12.0, 0.0, \ldots}$

The rule is, as long as a number can be written as ${m/n,}$ where ${m, n}$
are integers and ${n \neq 0,}$ then the number is rational
number.[^rationalnumberscs]

[^rationalnumberscs]:
    In computer science, the rational numbers are called **floats** or
    **floating point numbers** (the decimal point "floats" as needed).

Otherwise, the number is an irrational number. Note what this definition
means. Every integer satisfies the definition rational number definition,
so we say that the rational numbers are a proper superset of the integers.
In other words, every integer is a rational number, but not every rational
number is an integer.

### The Division Algorithm

Question: A six-digit number having 1 as its leftmost digit becomes three
times bigger if we take this digit off and put it at the end of the number.
What is this number?

Let the number be $1ABCDE$. Then, $ABCDE1 = 3 \times 1ABCDE$. Rewrite this
with the multiplication algorithm:

$$
\begin{array}{cc} & A & B & C & D & E \\ \times & & & & & 3 \\ \hline A & B
& C & D & E & 1 \end{array}
$$

Let's focus on $E$. We need a digit $E$ where $3 \times E = n1$, where $n$
is a digit. This digit must be 7, for $7 \times 3 = 21$. We know that $E$
is 7, so what might $D$ be? Well, we need a digit $D$ where
$(D \times 3) + 2 = 7$. Or, rearranging, $D \times 3 = 5$. The only digit
that would satisfy this condition is $D = 5$ (since $3 \times 5 + 2
= 17$.

We know that $D$ is 5, so now we look at $C$. We need a digit $C$ such that
$(C \times 3) + 1 = 5$, or, rearranging, $C \times 3 = 4$. There is only
one digit that satisfies this condition, 8. Thus, $C = 8$.

Now we look at $B$. What digit satisfies the condition $B \times 3 = 6$? It
must be 2. Therefore, $B = 2$.

Finally, we look at $A$. What digit results in $A \times 3 = 12$. It must
be 4, since $3 \times 4 = 12$. Hence, the digits are $A = 4$, $B = 2$,
$C = 8$, and $D = 5$.

Question: Divide 123123123 by 123. Again, we use the division algorithm:

$$
\begin{array}{r} 1001001 \\ 123{\overline{\smash{\big)}\,123123123}} \\ - 123 \phantom{123123} \\ \hline 0 123 \phantom{123} \\ - 123 \phantom{123} \\ \hline 0 123 \\ - 123 \\ \hline 0 \end{array}
$$

We can confirm the result with the multiplication algorithm:

$$
\begin{array}{cc} \begin{align*} 1001001 \\ \times \phantom{1001} 123
\\ \hline \phantom{00} 3 003 003 \\ \phantom{00} 2 002 002 \phantom{1} \\
+ \phantom{00} 1 001 001 \phantom{12} \\ \hline 123123123 \end{align*}
\end{array}
$$

Question: Can one predict the remainder when ${111
\ldots 1}$ (100 ones) is
divided by ${11 11 11 1}$?

$11 11 11 1$ is 7 ones. Consider a simpler case:

$$
\begin{array}{r} 10 \\ 11 {\overline{\smash{\big)}\, 111}} \\ -11
\phantom{0} \\ \hline \phantom{0} 01 \\ - \phantom{00} 0 \\ \hline
\phantom{000} 1 \end{array}
$$

Question: Divide $1000 \ldots 0$ (20 zeros) by 7.

Consider a simpler case:

$$
\begin{array}{r} 14 \\ 7 {\overline{\smash{\big)}\, 100}} \\ - 7
\phantom{0} \\ \hline 30 \\ - 28 \\ \hline 4 \end{array}
$$

Let's keep adding 0s to see if there's a pattern:

$$
\begin{array}{r} 142857 \\ 7 {\overline{\smash{\big)}\, 1 000 000}} \\
- 7 \phantom{000 00} \\ \hline 30 \phantom{000 0} \\ -28 \phantom{000 0}
\\ \hline 20 \phantom{000} \\ - 14 \phantom{000} \\ \hline 60 \phantom{00}
\\ - 56 \phantom{00} \\ \hline 40 \phantom{0} \\ - 35 \phantom{0} \\
\hline 50 \\ - 49 \\ \hline 1 \end{array}
$$

We return to a remainder of 1. This tells us that if we add another 0,
we're back at 10, which gives us 30, then 20, then 60, then 40, and so on.

This also tells us that after every six 0s, we return to 10. Thus, for
twenty 0s, we make 3 "laps" of returning to 10, with two more "runs":

- Lap 1 (six 0s): 142857 remainder 1
- Lap 2 (twelve 0s): 142857 14285 remainder 7
- Lap 3 (eighteen 0s): 142857 142857 remainder 1
- Lap 4 (nineteen 0s): 142857 142857 1 remainder 4
- Lap 5 (twenty 0s): 142857 142857 14 remainder 2

Hence, the quotient is: 14,285,714,285,714 + 2.
