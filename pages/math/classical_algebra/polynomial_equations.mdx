# Polynomial Equations

All linear equations are instances of polynomial equations.

> _Definition_. A one-variable polynomial equation is an equation of the
> form:
>
> $$
> a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_{1}x + a_0 = 0
> $$
>
> where ${a}$ is a constant and the exponents are nonnegative integers.

If ${ a_n \neq 0}$, then the degree of the polynomial equation is the
largest exponent accompanying a variable in the equation. For example, the
1-variable polynomial equation ${ 4x^2 - 5x - 1 = 0 }$ is a 1-variable
polynomial equation of degree 2, and the equation ${ 3x^5 - 2x^2 + 9 = 0 }$
is a 1-variable polynomial equation of degree 5.

A 1-variable polynomial equation of degree 1 is a linear equation. A
1-variable polynomial equation of degree 2 is a quadratic equation.
