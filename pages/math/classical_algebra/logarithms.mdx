# Logarithms

Consider the number 16. How many times can we divide 16 by 2? Let's try it:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	16 / 2 &= 8 \\
	8 / 2 &= 4 \\
	4 / 2 &= 2 \\
	2 / 2 &= 1
\end{aligned}
$$

Above, we can see that we can divide the number 16 by 2 a total of 4 times.
This corresponds to:

$$
\begin{aligned} 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 &= 2^4 \\ &= 16 \end{aligned}
$$

The answer to "How many times can we divide a number ${n}$ by this constant
${x?}$" is the **logarithm**. More formally:

> _Definition_. Given ${b = a^x,}$ ${a \neq 1,}$ ${a > 0,}$ and
> ${b > 0,}$ > ${a^x = b \iff x = \log_{a}b}$

We say that ${x}$ is the logarithm in base ${a}$ of ${b.}$ The logarithm
provides a way of deducing, and rewriting, the exponent of a number. For
example:

- ${2^3 = 8 \iff \log_{2}8 = 3}$
- ${5^2 = 25 \iff \log_{5}25 = 2}$
- ${10^3 = 1000 \iff \log_{10}1000 = 3}$

Suppose that ${y = a^x.}$ From the definition above, it follows that
${a =
\log_{a}y.}$ Then, it follows then that ${x = \log_{a}a^x}$ by
substitution. We state this as a corollary:

> _Corollary_. ${x = \log_{a}a^x}$

If ${x = a^y,}$ then again from the definition, ${y = \log_{a}x.}$ It
follows that ${x = a^{\log_{a}x},}$ provided that ${x > 0.}$ We again state
this as a corollary:

> _Corollary_. ${x = a^{\log_{a}x},}$ where ${x > 0}$

The definition and corollaries above directly lead to the **laws of
logarithms**:

> _Log Laws_. Where ${A, B \in \N,}$ ${c > 0,}$ and ${c \neq 1,}$
