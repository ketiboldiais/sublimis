# Solving Quadratic Equations

There are four primary ways of finding the truth set of quadratic
equations:

1. using the square root method;
2. factoring;
3. completing the square; and
4. using the quadratic equation

The next few sections explore how each of these methods are used.

## Completing the Square

Given the quadratic equation ${x^2 + Ax = B}$ ompleting the square can be
summarized into a simple algorithm:

1. Look at the cofficient of ${x.}$
2. $A$ Divide the coefficient by 2: ${\dfrac{A}{2}.}$
3. Square the result: ${\left(\dfrac{A}{2}\right)^2}$
4. Add the number from step 1 to both sides of the equation:
   $$
   	x^2 - Ax + \left(\dfrac{A}{2}\right)^2 = B + \left(\dfrac{A}{2}\right)^2
   $$
5. Simplify the equation.
6. Factor the result Solve for $x.$

For example, suppose we were confronted by the quadratic equation:

$$
	x^2 - 2x = 4.
$$

Applying the method of completing the square, we look at the coefficient of
$x$ first. We see that it's -2. We divide this number by 2 and square it:

$$
	\left(\dfrac{(-2)}{2}\right)^2 = 1.
$$

Then we add this number to both sides of the equation:

$$
	x^2 - 2x + 1 = 4 + 1.
$$

Simplifying, we obtain:

$$
	x^2 - 2x + 1 = 5
$$

We factor the left-hand side, and reach

$$
	(x-1)(x-1) = 5.
$$

Or, with a square,

$$
	(x-1)^2 = 5.
$$

Taking the square root of both sides, we have

$$
	x - 1 = \pm \sqrt{5}.
$$

(always be mindful of the the fact that squares result from both positive
and negative numbers). Finally, we solve for ${x}$ by adding 1 to both
sides:

$$x = 1 \pm \sqrt{5}.$$

Thus, the truth set of the equation ${x^2 - 2x = 4}$ is
${x \in \{ 1 + \sqrt{5}, 1 - \sqrt{5} \}.}$

## Why Does Completing the Square Work?

The method of completing the square follows from geometry. Suppose we had a
square, ${\square ABCD}$ with sides of length ${x}$:

![A square of arbitrary side length.](https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1652651951/math/square_of_length_x_cmldt4.svg)

We know that the area of ${\square ABCD}$ is ${x^2.}$ Now suppose that we
were to add a rectangle with a width of $b$ and a length of $x$ to the
square. This rectangle has an area of ${bx}$. When we add the rectangle, we
obtain a total area of ${x^2 + bx:}$

![Adding a rectangle of arbitrary width and length.](https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1652652009/math/rectangles_added_completing_the_square_fi7rne.svg)

Now suppose we rearranged the resulting shape by (1) splitting the added
rectangle vertically, (2) leaving one half at the original square's side,
and (3) moving the other half to the square's base:

![Rearranging the squares.](https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1652652082/math/rearrange_completing_the_square_cs3u5n.svg)

Notice that a gap is left. What might be the dimensions of the shape that
would fill that gap? Well, we know that the total area of the rectange we
created earlier is ${x^2 + bx}$. We also know that the two halves we
created must respectively have an area of ${x\left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right).}$
Thus, the shape we need to fill the gap must have an area of
${\left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)^2}$, or, simplifying the expression,
${\dfrac{b^2}{4}.}$

To see the connection to the algebraic method, consider the shape above
without filling the gap. That shape has an area of
${x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)x + \left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)x = x^2 + bx.}$
When we complete the square, we add the area of the "missing square":
${\dfrac{b^2}{4}.}$ Look familiar? Algebraically, the area of the
incomplete shape is a quadratic equation.

If we had an equation of the form ${ax^2 + bx + c}$, where $a$, $b$, and
$c$ are constants and ${a \neq 1,}$ that tells us that our original square
has an area of ${ax^2}$. That $a$ makes computations needlessly difficult,
and we want our original shape to be a square of area ${x^2}$. Since $a$ is
a constant, we can get rid of its place before $x$ by dividing all of the
terms in the equation by $a:$

$$
	x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)x + \dfrac{c}{a} = 0.
$$

We can then move the term ${\dfrac{c}{a}}$ to the right side of the
equation, to give us our incomplete shape:

$$
	x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)x = - \dfrac{c}{a}
$$

The term ${b/a}$ represents the side of our added rectangle. The side of
our halved rectangles then, is ${\frac{b/a}{2} = \frac{b}{2a}}$. And since
${\frac{b}{2a}}$ represents the side of our halved rectangles, the missing
square has an area of
${\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right) = \frac{b^2}{4a},}$
the term we add to both sides of
${x^2 + \left(\frac{b}{a}\right)x = - \frac{c}{a}.}$

## The Quadratic Formula

The truth set for quadratic equations cannot be found by simple
factorization. Instead, a more robust formula must be used: the quadratic
formula.

From the method of completing the square, we can derive the quadratic
formula, a formula that allows us to quickly deduce the truth set of a
quadratic equation. To derive the formula, we begin wtih the general
quadratic equation: ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0,}$ where ${a \neq 0.}$ We divide
both sides by $a$, and obtain:

$$
	x^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{a} \right)x + \left( \dfrac{c}{a} \right) = 0.
$$

Then we subtract ${\dfrac{c}{a}}$ from both sides, and obtain:

$$
	x^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{a} \right)x = - \left( \dfrac{c}{a} \right)
$$

Now we comlete the square, by adding ${\dfrac{b^2}{4a^2}}$ to both sides:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	x^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{a} \right)x + \dfrac{b^2}{4a^2} &= \dfrac{b^2}{4a^2} - \dfrac{c}{a} \\
	\left( x + \dfrac{b}{2a} \right)^2 &= \dfrac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2} \\
	x + \dfrac{b}{2a} &= \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}}\\
	&= \pm \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2 \lvert a \rvert } \\
	&= \pm \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - rac}}{2a}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the truth set of the quadratic equation ${a^2 + bx + c = 0}$ is:

$$
	x \in \left\{-\dfrac{b}{2a} + \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \space - \dfrac{b}{2a} - \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \right\}
$$

The quadratic formula will always yield the truth set for quadratic
equations of the form ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0.}$ In the event that the term
${b^2 - 4ac \in \mathbb{R}^-}$ (the discriminant), however, the truth set
of the equation consists of complex numbers, rather than real numbers.

Thus, given a quadratic equation of the form ${ax^2 + bx +c}$, where $a$,
$b$, and $c$ are constants and ${a \neq 0}$, the truth set of the equation
can be found with the equation:

$$
	x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)x + \dfrac{b^2}{4a} = - \dfrac{c}{a} + \dfrac{b^2}{4a}
$$

## The Discriminant

In the quadratic formula, the expression that appears below the radical
sign, ${b^2 - 4ac,}$ is called the discriminant. If the discriminant
evaluates to a positive real number, then the quadratic equation has 2 real
solutions. If the discriminant evaluates to 0, then the quadratic equation
has only 1 real solution. If the discriminant evaluates to a negative real
number, then the quadratic equation has no real solutions &mdash; instead,
it has a pair of complex conjugate solutions. Generalizing these results:

$$
	\text{roots} \begin{cases} \text{1 distinct real root} &\text{iff }
	b^2 - 4ac > 0 \\ \text{2 distinct real roots} &\text{iff } b^2 - 4ac =
	0 \\ \text{0 real roots} &\text{iff } b^2 - 4ac < 0 \end{cases}
$$

## The Product &amp; Sum of the Roots of ${x^2 + bx + c = 0}$

Suppose we were faced with the equation ${x^2 = 5 - 3x.}$ What are the
roots of this equation? First, let's rewrite the equation:

$$
	x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0.
$$

Then let's use the quadratic formula:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \\
&=\dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2-4(1)(-5)}}{2(1)} \\
&=\dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9+20}}{2} \\
&=\dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{29}}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the truth set of ${x^2 = 5 - 3x}$ is:

$$
	x \in \left\{ \dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29}}{2}, \space \dfrac{-3 - \sqrt{29}}{2}\right\}
$$

What would happen if we multiplied the two roots?

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\left( \dfrac{-3 - \sqrt{29}}{2} \right) \left( \dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29}}{2} \right) &= \dfrac{(-3)^2 - (\sqrt{29})^2}{4} \\
	&= \dfrac{9 - 29}{4}\\
	&= \dfrac{-20}{4} \\
	&= -5
\end{aligned}
$$

The product of the two roots is -5. What would happen if we added the two
roots?

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29}}{2} + \dfrac{-3 - \sqrt{29}}{2} &= \dfrac{-3 - \sqrt{29} + (-3) - \sqrt{29}}{2} \\
	&= \dfrac{-6}{2}\\
	&= -3
\end{aligned}
$$

The sum of the two roots is -3. Recall that the quadratic equation was
${x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0.}$ Is it pure coincidence that product of the two roots
is -5, the $c$ term in the equation, and the sum of the two roots, -3, is
the negative of the the $b$ term? Not a coincidence at all. In fact, it
follows from a more general rule.

> _Lemma_. Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of the quadratic equation

The general rule follows from manipulating the quadratic formula. Suppose
there exists a quadratic equation ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0,}$ where ${a = 1.}$
From the quadratic formula, it follows that the roots of the equation are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	x &= \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4(1)c}}{2(1)} \\[1em]
	&= \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the roots are:

$$
	r_1 = \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} \\[1em]
	r_2 = \dfrac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}
$$

The products of the roots:

$$
	r_1 r_2 = \left(\dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}\right) \left( \dfrac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} \right) \\[1em]
	\phantom{r_1 r_2} = \dfrac{b^2 - \left( b^2 - 4c \right)}{4} = \dfrac{4c}{4} = c
$$

And the sum of the roots:

$$
	r_1 + r_2 = \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} + \dfrac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} \\[1em]
	\phantom{r_1 + r_2} = \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4c} + (-b) - \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} = \dfrac{-2b}{2} = -b
$$
