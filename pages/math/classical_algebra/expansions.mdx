# Expansions

There are some expansions that every student in mathematics should know. An
**expansion** is just a way of rewriting &mdash; expanding &mdash; a
shortened expression. The expansions are the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	(a + b)^2 &= a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\
	(a - b)^2 &= a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \\
	(a + b)(a - b) &= a^2 - b^2
\end{aligned}
$$
