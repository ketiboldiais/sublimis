# Inequations

Most critical findings in mathematics result from inequalities rather than
equations. And understandibly so &mdash; it is often easier to determine
whether particular expressions are greater or less than others, in
comparison to concluding that they are equal. Whenever we replace the equal
sign in an equation with one of the symbols ${\leq}$ or ${\geq,}$ we obtain
an an **inequation**. Both equations and inequations are mathematical
statements. As such, inequations, like equations, have truth sets &mdash;
the set of all values that render the inequality true if any member of that
set is substituted into a variable, or variables, of the inequality.

For example, suppose ${2x - 3 < 8.}$ The value ${x = 5}$ would be a member
of the inequation's truth set, since ${2(5) - 3 = 7 < 8.}$ The value
${x = 10,}$ however, would not be a member of that truth set, since
${2(10) - 3 = 17 \nless 8.}$ We can find the entire truth set for the
inequation by solving for $x$, using the same techniques for equations:

$$
	2x - 3 < 8 = 2x - 3 + 3 < 8 + 3 \\
	2x < 8 + 3 \\
	2x < 11 \\
	x < \dfrac{11}{2} \\
$$

Although inequations can be solved by mostly applying the techniques for
equations, there are some situations we should take care when handling.
Particularly, we must be careful whenever we multiply or divide both sides
of an inequation by the same nonzero number.

For example, suppose ${1 < 3.}$ If we multiplied both sides of the
inequality by 10, we would obtain ${10 < 30.}$ Clearly this is true. But if
were to multiply both sides by -5, we would obtain ${-5 < -15.}$ This is
false. This observation returns 2 general rules:

> _Lemma_. If both sides of an inequation are multiplied or divided by a
> positive real number, then the inequation is preserved.

> _Lemma_. If both sides of an inequation are multiplied or divided by a
> negative real number, then the inequation is reversed.

More explicit rules:

> _Lemma_. If ${a < b,}$ then ${a + c < b + c,}$ and ${a - c < b - c.}$

> _Lemma_. If ${a < b}$ and ${c \in \mathbb{R}^+,}$ then ${ac < bc,}$ and >
> ${\dfrac{a}{c} < \dfrac{b}{c}.}$

> _Lemma_. ${a < b}$ and ${c \in \mathbb{R}^-,}$ then ${ac > bc,}$ and >
> ${\dfrac{a}{c} > \dfrac{b}{c}.}$

> _Lemma_. If ${a < b}$ and ${b < c,}$ then ${a < c.}$
