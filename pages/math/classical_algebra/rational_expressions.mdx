# Rational Expressions

The quotient of two polynomial expressions is called a _rational
expression_. When handling rational expressions, we use the same rules
applicable to fractions.

## Simplifying Rational Expressions.

Simplifying a rational expressions is no different from simplifying a
fraction. The only differences is that we must often use the techniques of
factorization, as well as be mindful of the laws governing variable
manipulation. To simplify a rational expression:

1. Factor the numerator and denominator;
2. cancel any common factors

For example:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\dfrac{x^2 - 9}{x^2 + 4x + 3} &= \dfrac{(x+3)(x-3)}{(x+3)(x+1)} \\
	&= \dfrac{\cancel{(x+3)}(x-3)}{\cancel{(x+3)}(x+1)}
	&= \dfrac{(x-3)}{(x+1)}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Multiplying Rational Expressions.

We follow the same procedures for multiplying fractions when we multiply
rational expressions: To multiply two rational expressions:

1. Factor the numerator and denominator;
2. multiply the numerators;
3. multiply the denominators
4. simplify.

For example, given:

$$
	\left(\dfrac{x^2 + 4x - 5}{3x + 18}\right)\left(\dfrac{2x-1}{x+5}\right)
$$

By factorization:

$$
	\left(\dfrac{x^2 + 4x - 5}{3x + 18}\right)\left(\dfrac{2x-1}{x+5}\right) = \left(\dfrac{(x+5)(x-1)}{3(x+6)}\right)\left(\dfrac{2x-1}{x+5}\right)
$$

Using the associative property of multiplication:

$$
	\left(\dfrac{x^2 + 4x - 5}{3x + 18}\right)\left(\dfrac{2x-1}{x+5}\right) = \dfrac{(x+5)(x-1)(2x-1)}{3(x+6)(x+5)}
$$

Cancelling like terms:

$$
	\left(\dfrac{x^2 + 4x - 5}{3x + 18}\right)\left(\dfrac{2x-1}{x+5}\right) = \dfrac{\cancel{(x+5)}(x-1)(2x-1)}{3(x+6)\cancel{(x+5)}}
$$

We can thus conclude:

$$
	\left(\dfrac{x^2 + 4x - 5}{3x + 18}\right)\left(\dfrac{2x-1}{x+5}\right) = \dfrac{(x-1)(2x-1)}{3(x+6)}
$$

## Adding &amp; Subtracting Rational Expressions.

Once more, adding and subtracting rational expressions works the same way
was adding and subtracting fractions: We may add and subtract the fractions
iff the rational expressions have a common denominator. To ease the
computation, the _least common denominator_ &mdash; the smallest multiple
that the denominators have in common &mdash; should be used whenever
possible.

To add or subtract rational expressions:

1. Factor the numerator and denominator.
2. Find the least common denominator of the expressions &mdash; to find the
   least common denominator:
   1. Factor the expressions.
   2. Multiply all of the distinct factors.
3. Multiply the expressions by a form of 1 that changes the denominators to
   the LCD.
4. Add or subtract the numerators. Simplify.

For example, given:

$$
	\dfrac{5}{x} + \dfrac{6}{y}
$$

The least common denominator is ${(x)(y).}$ Multiplying the expressions by
a form of 1 to ensure the denominator is the least common denominator:

$$
	\left(\dfrac{5}{x} \cdot \dfrac{y}{y}\right) + \left(\dfrac{6}{y} \cdot \dfrac{x}{x} \right)
$$

Carrying out the multiplication:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\left(\dfrac{5}{x} \cdot \dfrac{y}{y}\right) + \left(\dfrac{6}{y} \cdot \dfrac{x}{x} \right) &= \dfrac{5y}{xy} + \dfrac{6x}{xy} \\
	&= \dfrac{5y + 6x}{xy}}$
\end{aligned}
$$

## Simplifying Nested Rational Expressions

Often, the numerators and denominators of a rational expression will
themselves contain rational expressions. They might look like:

$$
	\dfrac{a + \dfrac{b}{c}}{\dfrac{d}{e} + \dfrac{f}{g}}
$$

We call such expressions _nested rational expressions_ (the rational
expressions in the numerators and denominators are colloquially called
_nesting rats_). Nested rational expressions often strike fear in students,
partly because of their size, partly because they are not often
encountered. Nested rational expressions, however, are a good example of
where _Polish notation_ has an advantage over the more common _infix
notation_ (the notation above). The same expression above can be expressed
as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	(/ \space &[+ \space a \space (/ \space b \space c)] \\[1em] &[+ \space (/ \space d \space e) (/ \space f \space g)])
\end{aligned}
$$

When encountering deeply nested rational expressions like the above,
consider rewriting the expression in Polish notation and simplifying the
expression from inside to outside. For most nested rational expressions,
however, we use the following algorithm:

1. Combine the expressions in the numerator into a single rational
   expression by adding or subtracting.

2. Combine the expressions in the denominator into a single rational
   expression by adding or subtracting.

3. Rewrite the overall expression as the numerator divided by the
   numerator.

4. Rewrite the overall expression as a multplication.

5. Multiply.

6. Simplify.

For exmaple, given:

$$
	\dfrac{y + \dfrac{1}{x}}{\dfrac{x}{y}}
$$

Combine the expressions in the numerator into a single expression:

$$
	\dfrac{\dfrac{yx}{x} + \dfrac{1}{x}}{\dfrac{x}{y}} = \dfrac{\dfrac{yx + 1}{x}}{\dfrac{x}{y}}
$$

Rewrite the expression as multiplication:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\dfrac{\dfrac{yx}{x} + \dfrac{1}{x}}{\dfrac{x}{y}} &= \dfrac{yx + 1}{x} \cdot \dfrac{y}{x} \\
	&= \dfrac{y(xy + 1)}{x^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Rationalizing Radical Denominators

Rational expressions can contain radicals in the denominator. These can be
cumbersome to handle, and it is almost always best to simplify them.

To remove radicals from the denominators of rational expressions, we
multiply the radical expression by the form of 1 that will eliminate the
radical. If the denominator contains a single term, we multiply the
rational expression by its reciprocal. I.e., if the rational-radical
expression is ${\dfrac{1}{b \sqrt{c}},}$ we multiply the expression by
${\dfrac{\sqrt{c}}{\sqrt{c}}.}$

Now, if the denominator of the rational-radical expression contains the sum
of a rational and an irrational term, we multiply the numerator and the
denominator by the conjugate of the denominator &mdash; the expression
wherein the sign of the radial portion of the denominator is made opposite.
For example, if the denominator is ${a + b \sqrt{c},}$ then the conjuage is
${a - b \sqrt{c}.}$

Given a radical expression of the form ${\dfrac{a}{\sqrt{b}},}$

1. Multiply the numerator and the denominator by the radical in the
   denominator.

2. Simplify.
