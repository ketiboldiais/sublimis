# Perfect Powers

With exponentiation, we arrive at several special properties. First, we
have the notion of a **perfect square**. The set of all perfect square
looks something like:

${\{ 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, \ldots \}}$

Notice the pattern. These are all numbers that can be written in the form
${n^2,}$ where ${n}$ is some integer. for example, ${9}$ is a perfect
square because it can be written as ${3^2.}$ So too are ${1}$ and ${0.}$
They can be written as ${1^2}$ and ${0^2,}$ respectively. Formally:

> _Definition_. A _perfect square_ is a positive integer ${n}$ such that:
> ${n = m^2 \space \space \space (m \in \Z^{+})}$

Alongside perfect squares, we have the **perfect cube**. The set of all
perfect cubes looks like:

${\{ 0, 1, 8, 27, 54, 125, 216, 343, 512 \}}$

And the formal definition:

> Definition. A _perfect cube_ is a positive integer ${n}$ such that:
> ${n = m^3 \space \space \space (m \in \Z^{+})}$

Both perfect squares and perfect cubes are examples of **perfect powers**.
In other words, we can have a "perfect tesseract"[^perfecttesseract]

[^perfecttesseract]:
    A "perfect tesseract" is not a formal term. The names "square" and
    "cube" come directly from geometry, so the next logical name would be a
    tesseract &mdash; perfect squares of squares. A more general definition
    for the perfect power:

> Definition. A positive integer ${n}$ is a _perfect power of ${x}$_ iff:
> ${n = m^x \space \space \space (m \in \Z, \space x \in \Z^{+})}$
