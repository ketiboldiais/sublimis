## The Numbers

Below are some of the key laws of numbers.

> Associative Law of Addition: ${a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c}$

> Existence of an Additive Identity: ${a + 0 = 0 + a = a}$

> Existence of Additive Inverse: ${a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0}$

> Commutative Law for Addition: ${a + b = b + a}$

> Associative Law for Multiplication:
> ${a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c}$

> Existence of a Multiplicative Identity:
> ${a \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot a = a; \space 1 \neq 0}$

> Existence of Multiplicative Inverses:
> ${a \cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \cdot a = 1; \text{ for } a \neq 0}$

> Commutative Law for Multiplication: ${a \cdot b = b \cdot a}$

> Distributive Law: ${a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c}$

Keeping these laws in mind, let's cover some rudimentary rules and
definitions about numbers. We will often revisit these topics over and over
again, as numbers cannot be avoided in mathematics.

## Integers

The integers are the numbers we use for counting (also called the cardinal
numbers in other contexts), and their negatives. They are denoted with the
special symbol, ${\Z,}$ from the German zehr, meaning "number".

${ \Z = \{ \ldots , \texttt{-}4, \texttt{-}3, \texttt{-}2, \texttt{-}1, 0,
1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots \} }$

Some elementary mathematical texts call the counting numbers the whole
numbers, and go so far as to denote them with the symbol ${\mathbb{W}.}$
This terminology is seldom used in higher level mathematics, so we'll stick
to the more common integers. Nevertheless, the idea of a whole number is
helpful for communicating the notion of an integer, so we'll momentarily
use it.

But what is a whole number? We can think of the whole number as such: If a
number has at least one non-zero digit after its decimal point, then it is
not a "whole number" because we cannot count from or to zero with that
number exactly 1 unit at a time on the number line. For example, ${1.1}$ is
not a whole number, because no matter how much we try, to get to zero, we
have to subtract ${0.1.}$ This is not 1 unit, so it does not constitute a
whole number. And since it does not constitute a whole number, it is not an
integer.

The whole numbers greater than ${0}$ are called the positive integers. We
can think of these numbers as the numbers we use to count forwards (e.g.,
inserting a certain amount of objects into a space).

$$ \Z^{+} = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots \} $$

Notice symbol for the set, a zehr with a superscripted plus sign. And the
whole numbers less than ${0}$ are called the negative integers. Here, we
can think of these numbers as the numbers we use to count backwards (e.g.,
removing a certain number of objects from a space).

$$
\Z^{-} = \{ \ldots , \texttt{-}4, \texttt{-}3, \texttt{-}2, \texttt{-}1
\}
$$

The number ${0}$ is neither negative nor positive. It has a special
duality: It is both a non-positive and non-negative number. The
non-positive integers are negative integers including zero:

$$
\Z_{\leq 0} = \{ \ldots , \texttt{-}4, \texttt{-}3, \texttt{-}2,
\texttt{-}1, 0 \}
$$

and the non-negative integers are the positive integers including zero:

$$\Z_{\geq 0} = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots \} $$

### The Natural Numbers

We define the natural numbers as the positive integers including zero
(i.e., the nonnegative integers). These are what we refer to as the
counting numbers in regular speech. Importantly, mathematicians differ on
whether ${0}$ is a natural number. This is more a matter of convenience
than anything else, but in these materials, we follow the premise that
${0}$ is a natural number. If there is a variation, we will explicitly
state that ${0}$ is not included in the set.

$$\N = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \ldots \} $$

Some texts define the natural numbers as the positive integers, and instead
refer to the nonnegative integers as the whole numbers. For reasons beyond
the scope of the current discussion, defining the natural numbers as
including zero has benefits for later sections.

With the natural numbers covered, we can begin discussing some laws of
arithmetic. There are many other number sets, but we will explore them as
we encounter a need for their definitions.

## Laws of Arithmetic

The following materials discuss arithmetic, the set of rules and
conventions governing the manipulation of numbers. The word arithmetic is
derived from the Greek arithmetike, meaning "art of counting," which is
itself derived from the Greek arithmos, meaning "number."

There are four basic arithmetic operators:

| Symbol         | Operation      |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| $a + b$        | Addition       |
| $a - b$        | Subtraction    |
| $a \times b$   | Multiplication |
| $\dfrac{a}{b}$ | Division       |
| $a^b$          | Exponentiation |

Above, we used the letters $a$ and $b$. These are called variables. They
are simply placeholders that we can plug numbers, other variables, or even
other operations with variables into. Variables allow us to generalize, or
abstract, statements. For example, ${2 + 2 = 4}$, and ${3 + 8 = 11}$. We
make an abstraction of this pattern, or idea, by writing something like
${a + b = n.}$ This communicates the idea, "The number ${n}$ is the sum of
${a}$ and ${b.}$"

There are many ways to read an equation, but they all express the same
idea. The human mind, however, is a peculiar thing. Often, reading and
writing the same equation in different ways can lead to drastically
different insights. Consider all the different ways we can read
${a + b = n:}$ The sum of ${a}$ and ${b}$ is ${n.}$ The number ${n}$ is the
sum of ${a}$ and ${b.}$ The numbers ${a}$ and ${b}$ such that the sum is
${n.}$ The number ${b}$ is the difference of ${n}$ and ${a.}$

All of this is to say that addition and subtraction are just fast and
flexible ways to express counting forwards and backwards. For example, the
expression ${4 + 8}$ is just another way of saying "Count ${8}$ positions
from ${4}$." This leads to: ${5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.}$ This in turn is
just another way of saying "Count ${12}$ positions from ${0}$" or "Count
${1}$ position from ${11.}$" Notice that with these addition (and
subtraction), we are just offsetting from one or the other of the operands.
${1 + 1}$ is simply "1 offset 1," which is ${2.}$

All of this evidences that addition and subtraction are abstractions of
counting. Abstractions are useful because they allow us greater flexibility
and accuracy with our statements. Suppose we want to say, "I'm looking for
two numbers that add to 10." We can write: $a + b = 10$. This flexibility
and accuracy is a powerful tool in mathematics, because it gives us plenty
of room to write statements that say what we can and cannot do &mdash;
rules.

Understanding the basic rules of arithmetic at a very high level is
priceless in mathematics. Part of the elegance and power of mathematics is
that we can arrive at beautiful, and often shocking, results from a set of
very basic rules.
