# Radicals & Rational Expressions

By introducing the exponentiation notation, it would be very helpful to
have notation that quickly reverses the results. This notation is provided
by the radical. The syntax:

## The Square Root

Suppose we have a number ${a}$ where ${a \in \R^{+}.}$ The **square root**
of ${a}$ is the number that, when multiplied by itself, i.e., ${a^2,}$
returns ${a.}$ Now, that number may be positive or negative, because
squaring two numbers, positive or negative, yields a positive number.

> _Definition_. Given ${a \in \R^{+},}$ ${\sqrt{a}}$ is the number ${n,}$
> where ${n \in \R}$ such that ${n^2 = a.}$

From the square root definition, we have the following rule:

> _The Product Rule of Square Roots_. Given ${a \in \R_{\geq 0}}$ and
> ${b \in \R_{\geq 0},}$ ${\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b}}$

When simplifying radical expressions, there is a useful algorithm:

1. Algorithm. Given a square root radical expression:
2. Factor perfect squares from the radicand.
3. Write the radical expression as a product of radical expressions.
4. Simplify.

For example, consider implifying the following radical expression:

$$
\sqrt{300}
$$

Factoring the perfect square:

$$
	\sqrt{100 \cdot 3}
$$

By the product rule:

$$
	\sqrt{100} \cdot \sqrt{3}
$$

Then, simplifying:

$$
	10 \sqrt{3}
$$

Here's another example. Consider this square root:

$$
	\sqrt{162 a^2 b^4}
$$

Factoring:

$$
	\sqrt{81 \cdot 2 \cdot a^4 \cdot a \cdot b^4}
$$

Then, by the product rule of square roots:

$$
	(\sqrt{81}) (\sqrt{2}) (\sqrt{a}) (\sqrt{a^4}) (\sqrt{b^4})
$$

And simplifying:

$$
	(9) (\sqrt{2}) (\sqrt{a}) (a^2) (b^2)
$$

By commutativity:

$$
	9a^2 b^2 \sqrt{2a}
$$

Another useful algorithm is combining multiple radical expressions into a
single radical expression:

1. Combine all the multiple radical expressions into a single expression.
2. Simplify.

For example, consider the radical expression: ${(\sqrt{12})(\sqrt{3}).}$ We
can multiply the this expression's terms into a single expression:

$$
	(\sqrt{12})(\sqrt{3}) = \sqrt{36}
$$

## The Quotient Rule of Square Roots

The _Quotient Rule of Square Roots_ natural results from multiplication.
First, suppose the following:

1. ${a, b \geq 0.}$
2. ${c = \sqrt{\dfrac{a}{b}}.}$
3. ${x = \sqrt{a}}$ and ${y = \sqrt{b}.}$

This implies that ${x^2 = a}$ and ${y^2 = b.}$ Next, suppose exists a
nonnegative number ${n}$ such that ${\sqrt{n^2} = n.}$ It follows that, by
substitution: $$ \left(\dfrac{x}{y}\right)^2 = \dfrac{x^2}{y^2} =
\dfrac{a}{b} $$

Hence,

$$
c = \dfrac{x}{y} = \sqrt{\dfrac{a}{b}} =
\dfrac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}
$$

by Assumptions 2 and 3. Thus, we have the following rule:

> Property. Let ${a, b \geq 0.}$ Suppose ${n = \sqrt{\dfrac{a}{b}},}$ where
> ${n \in \R_{\geq 0}.}$ Then:
> $$n = \sqrt{\dfrac{a}{b}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}$$

The rule above is particularly useful for rational expressions, which often
contain radicands. Here's a useful algorithm for handling such expressions.
Given a radical expression in the form of a quotient:

1. Write the radical quotient has the quotient of two radical expressions.
2. Simplify the numerator and denominator.

## Adding and Subtracting Square Roots

We can add or subtract radical expressions only if (1) they have the same
radicand and (2) they have the same ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ root.
For example:

$$\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{2} = 4 \sqrt{2}$$

Radican expressions can often be simplified by rewriting the relevant
expression as a sum, followed by reductions.

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{18} &= \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2 \cdot 9} \\
	&= \sqrt{2} + (\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{9}) \\
	&= \sqrt{2} + 3 \sqrt{2} \\
	&= 4 \sqrt{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Here's a helpful algorithm. Given an expression that adds or subtract
radical expressions,

1. Simplify each radical expression to yield as many equal radicands as
   possible.
2. Add or subtract expressions with equal radicands.

## nth Root

The proposition ${a^3 = 8,}$ implies that ${\sqrt[3]{8} = a.}$ Thus, the
phrase "the ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ root of ${a}$" implies a number
that, when raised to the the ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ power, equals
${a.}$

If ${a}$ is a real number with at least one ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$
root, then the **principal ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ root** of ${a}$
is the number with the same sign as ${a}$ that, when raised to the
${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ power, equals ${a.}$

> Definition. Let ${a \in \R,}$ where ${a}$ has at least one
> ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ root.

Then the principle ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ root of ${a,}$ written as
${\sqrt[n]{a},}$ is the number with the same sign as ${a,}$ such that, when
raised to the ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ power, equals ${a.}$ We say
that ${n}$ is the **index** of ${\sqrt[n]{a}.}$

## Rational Exponents

Rather than using a radical symbol, we can express radical expressions with
rational exponents. Needless to say, the index of such an exponent must be
a positive integer:

$$a^{\frac{1}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a}$$

A useful fact: If the index ${n}$ is even, then ${a}$ cannot be negative.

We can also have rational exponents with numerators other than 1. If the
numerator is a number other than 1, then we raise the base to a power and
take an ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ root. The numerator tells us the
power, and the denominator tells us the root:

$$a^{\frac{m}{n}} = (\sqrt[n]{a})^{m} = \sqrt[n]{a^{m}}$$

Here's a useful procedure for handling rational exponents. Given an
expression with a rational exponent:

1. Determine the power by looking at the exponent's numerator. Determine
   the root by looking at the exponent's denominator.

2. Using the base as the radicand, raise the radicand to the power and use
   the root as the index.
