# Multiplication

Multiplication is simply repeated addition. Accordingly, we can think of
multiplication as an even faster method of counting. For example,
${2 \cdot 2}$ is just another way of saying "Move 2 positions 2 times
forward, from the origin." This leads to 4. Similarly,
${2 \cdot \texttt{-}3}$ is equivalent to, "Move 2 positions 3 timees
backward, from the origin." This leads to ${\texttt{-}6.}$ This reveals
that whenever we write the expression ${a \cdot b,}$ there's an implicit
${(a \cdot b) + 0.}$ Whenever we multiply integers, the following rule
holds true:

> _Closure Property of Multiplication_. The product of two integers is an
> integer.

## Laws of Multiplication

Like addition, there are several laws of multiplication. These are
equivalent to the laws of addition with just a few differences.

### Commutative Law of Multiplication.

The commutative law of multiplication states that we the order in which we
multiply two real numbers ${a}$ and ${b}$ doesn't affect the result. In
other words, we can freely move terms around and arrive at the same
product.[^mnemonic]

[^mnemonic]:
    A helpful mnemonic for the commutative law: "Factors freely flow."

> _Commutative Property of Multiplication._ >
> ${a \cdot b = b \cdot a = (a)(b) = (b)(a)}$

### Reciprocal Law of Multiplication

What is the result of ${2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}?}$ Clearly, it is ${1.}$ How
about ${3 \cdot \frac{1}{3}?}$ It's also ${1.}$ Indeed,
${n \cdot \dfrac{1}{n}}$ will always return ${1,}$ where ${n}$ is a real
number. We call this the _reciprocal law of multiplication_:

> _Reciprocal Law of Multiplication._ Given any ${n \neq 0,}$ there exists
> a number ${n^{-1} = \dfrac{1}{n}}$ such that:
> $$n \cdot n^{-1} = n^{-1} \cdot n = 1$$

While we haven't covered exponents yet, the notation ${n^{\texttt{-}1}}$ is
the same as the expression ${\dfrac{1}{n}}$. We call the number
${n^{\texttt{-}1}}$ the **reciprocal** or the **multiplicative inverse** of
the number ${n.}$ The law above tells us that multiplying a real number by
its reciprocal always yields the number ${1,}$ as long as that real number
isn't ${0.}$ Why not ${0?}$ Because if ${n = 0,}$ then we would have the
reciprocal ${\dfrac{1}{0}.}$ And for our purposes, division by ${0}$ is
always _undefined_.

### Associative Law of Multiplication

The associative law of multiplication tells us that we can group factors
however way we'd like, and still arrive at the same
product.[^assocmnemonic]

[^assocmnemonic]:
    A helpful mnemonic for the associative law: "Factors freely faction."

> _Associative Property of Multiplication._ ${ (ab)c = a(bc)}$

The laws of commutativity and associativity apply whether ${ a }$, ${ b }$,
and ${ c }$ are negative, positive, or 0.

### Multiplication by Zero

A man goes to a café and asks the barista for a Bombón. The barista asks,
"How many tablespoons of sugar would you like?" The man replies,
"Zero."[^kantfootnote]

Question: How many table spoons of sugar would the man get? Very clearly
zero! Zero of something is zero. We state this property of multiplication
formally:

> _Zero Property of Multiplication._ Given any real number ${a,}$ >
> ${0 \cdot a = 0}$

[^kantfootnote]:
    As an aside, the coffee example above is a play on the philosopher
    Slavoj Zizek's joke:

        A man comes into a restaurant. He sits down at the table and he says, “Waiter, bring me a cup of coffee without cream.” Five minutes later, the waiter comes back and says, “I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream. Can it be without milk?”

    Zizek's joke is an attempt at revitilizing Hegelian logic through an
    alternative reading. The idea is that the existence of a negation can
    be just as significant and worthy of consideration as the negation
    itself. In other words, when we encounter the proposition "coffee
    without cream", it's just as important to consider the possibility that
    what's being expressed is not "coffee _without cream_", but rather
    "coffee _without_".

    This idea has its roots in Kant's essay _An Attempt to Introduce the
    Concept of Negative Magnitudes of Philosophy._ There, Kant presented a
    thought experiment: Two equal forces start at zero. One moves five feet
    to the right, the other moves five feet to the left. Is the zero
    resulting from their movement different from the zero they started at?
    Kant argued yes, they are different. The "zero" resulting from the two
    forces cancelling one another is different from the zero before any
    force moved. The ${+5}$ and the ${-5}$ have in themselves a ${0,}$ in
    that ${+5}$ means "Move 5 to the right from ${0}$" and ${-5}$ means
    "Move 5 to the left from ${0.}$" That inherent ${0}$ never went
    anywhere. It's always been there.

    Hegel took this several steps further by arguing that the zero we get
    from ${5 + (-5)}$ is not only different, but that the process of
    negation alters the very thing we're negating. ${5 + (-5)}$ results in
    a non-being ${0,}$ from a process that starts with a being, the origin
    ${0.}$ This is the act of _negation_, and its result is different from
    zero, which represents nothingness. In Hegel's view, nothingness is
    always there. It requires no action by another to "be". In contrast,
    negation &mdash; the act of ${(5) + (-5)}$ &mdash; requires an action
    by another.

    Hegel's arguments on negation (and logic in general), no doubt had an
    impact on mathematical logic. In particular, Hegel's formulation of the
    _absolute_ (a concept that follows from his work on negations) is
    contemporaneous with the concept of _absolute value_, a topic to be
    discussed in later sections.

    The zero property of multiplication may seem straightforward, but it
    leads a particularly useful fact to keep in mind. The equation
    ${a \cdot b = a \cdot c}$ does not immediately imply that ${b = c.}$
    Why? Because if ${a = 0,}$ then either ${b}$ or ${c}$ could be any real
    number and ${b \neq c.}$ Never assume that ${ab = ac}$ implies
    ${b = c}$ without first verifying, or stating explicitly, that
    ${a \neq 0.}$

    Additionally, if we know that ${a \cdot b = 0,}$ then we have three
    possibilities: (1) ${a = 0,}$ (2) ${b = 0,}$ or (3) ${a = 0}$ and
    ${b = 0.}$

### Identity Property of Multiplication

Ayuri is about to walk to a smoke shop to buy some flavored tobacco. She
asks her roommate Elena, "Do you want any flavored tobacco?" looking for
flavored tobacco. Elena responds, "I do need some flavored tobacco." "What
would you like?" Ayuri asks. Elena answers, "Surprise me." At the smoke
shop, Ayuri asks the shopkeeper what flavors of tobacco the shop has. The
shopkeeper says, "There are 100 flavors &mdash; tobacco, mint, mango, lemon
... " enumerating each. After several minutes, Ayuri responds, "One of
each!" Ayuri returns home with a heavy bag, greeted by her roommate Elena
with, "Good grief, how many did you buy?" Ayuri stares, "100 I think.".

The computation above is governed by the **identity law of
multiplication**. More formally:

> _Identity Law of Multiplication._ Given ${a \in \R,}$ then:
> ${1 \cdot a = a.}$

The above rules allow us to perform elaborate simplifications:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	(2a)(5b) &= 2(a(5b)) ~\text{by associativity}\\
	&= 2(5a)b ~\text{by commutativity}\\
	&= ( 2 \cdot 5 )ab ~\text{by associativity}\\
	&= 10ab
\end{aligned}
$$

The above example represents a useful technique when handling expressions
involving multiple factors: group all of the integers into a single
multiplication expression, and all of the variables elsewhere.

1. Numbers consisting entirely of the digit "8" are added, resulting in the
   sum 1000. What are these numbers?

   First, assume the following:

   $$
   \begin{matrix}
   	\begin{alignedat}{8}
   		\ldots 8 \\\ldots \\ + \space \ldots 8 \\ \hline 1000
   	\end{alignedat}
   \end{matrix}
   $$

   What we know: Each number ends with an 8. Since the sum is 1000, the sum
   of the last digit, an 8, is 0.

2. How many 8s do we need to arrive at a sum where the last digit is 0?

   At least five 8s, since $8 \times 5 = 40$. Thus, we have:

   $$
   \begin{matrix}
   	\begin{alignedat}{8} \ldots 8 \\ \ldots 8 \\ \ldots 8 \\ \ldots 8 \\ + \space \ldots 8 \\ \hline 1000
   	\end{alignedat}
   \end{matrix}
   $$

   Now note that there is a 4 that must be carried to the next place. To
   keep the sum's digits 0, we need a sum of 8s and a 4 that returns the
   last digit 0. We know that $8 + 8 + 4 = 20$. Further, we need one more 8
   to get a 10:

   $$
   \begin{matrix} \begin{alignedat}{8} 8 \\ 8 \\ 8 \\ 88 \\ + \space 888 \\ \hline 1000 \end{alignedat} \end{matrix}
   $$

   Thus, the numbers are 8, 8, 8, 88, and 888.

3. Suppose the following:

   $$
   \begin{matrix} \begin{align*} AAA \\ + \space BBB \\ \hline AAAC
   \end{align*} \end{matrix}
   $$

   The ${As}$ denote some digit, the ${Bs}$ denote another digit, and
   ${Cs}$ denotes a third digit. What are these digits?

   To start, we are looking for a number where $A + B = nC$, where $n$ and
   $C$ are digits. Furthermore, $A + B + n = mA$, where $m$ and $A$ are
   digits. Then, $m + A + B = AAA$. Next, we note that $A + B$ must result
   in a two digit number. Second, we further note that $A$ appears in the
   thousands position of the result ($AAAC$). Because $A$ appears in the
   thousands place, no other digit can be carried over into the thousands
   place.

   There is only one number for $B$ that can satisfy these conditions
   &mdash; 9.

   $$
   \begin{align*}
    111 \\ + \space 999 \\ \hline 1110
   \end{align*}
   $$

4. Daniel claims that he can multiply any three-digit number by 1001
   instantly. If his friend, Helga, says to him, "715" he gives the answer
   immediately. Compute his answer and explain Daniel's secret.

   First, $715 \times 1001 = 715715$. We can see this with the
   multiplication algorithm:

   $$
   \begin{array}{cc} & & & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \times & & & & 7 & 1 & 5
   \\ \hline & & & 5 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ & & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ + & 7 & 0 & 0
   & 7 \\ \hline & 7 & 1 & 5 & 7 & 1 & 5 \end{array}
   $$

   Under the multiplication algorithm, Daniel simply takes the three
   digits, ABC, and performs the following:

   $C00C$ $B00B$ $A00A$

   Then, he adds the numbers, shifting one place to the left on each line:

   $$
   \begin{array}{cc} & & & C & 0 & 0 & C \\ & & B & 0 & 0 & B \\ + &
   A & 0 & 0 & A \\ \hline & A & B & C & A & B & C \end{array}
   $$

   The result then is $ABCABC$, a repetition of the digits $ABC$. Note
   further that there are two 0s, and the digits are repeated twice.

5. Compute $1010101010 \times 57$.

   The multiplication algorithm tells us that we are simply shifting the
   number 57 over and over, but, with an added 0, since the the first place
   does not shift:

   $$
   \begin{array}{cc} & 01 & 01 & 01 & 01 & 01 & 01 \\ & & & & & & 57
   \\ \hline & & 57 & 57 & 57 & 57 & 57
   \end{array}
   $$

   Thus, the product is 5757575757.

6. Compute $10001 \times 1020304050$.

   Solution We can compute this with the following:

   $$
   \begin{array}{cc} & & & 10 & 20 & 30 & 40 & 50 \\ \times & & & &
   & 01 & 00 & 01 \\ \hline & & & 10 & 20 & 30 & 40 & 50 \\ & & 00 & 00
   & 00 & 00 & 00 & 00 \\ + & 10 & 20 & 30 & 40 & 50 \\ \hline & 10 &
   20 & 40 & 60 & 80 & 40 & 50 \end{array}
   $$

   Thus, the product is 10204060804050.

7. Compute $11111 \times 1111$. Rewriting the expression with the
   multiplication algorithm:

   $$
   \begin{array}{cc} & & & & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \times & & & & & 1
   & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline & & & & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ & & & 1 & 1 & 1 &
   1 & 1 \\ & & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ + & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline &
   1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 \end{array}
   $$
