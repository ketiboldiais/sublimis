# Expressions

In algebra, we use letters like ${x,}$ ${y,}$ ${n,}$ and ${m}$ to represent
numbers. We call such letters variables. When we combine these variables
with mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication,
etc., we have an expression. For example, the following are all
expressions:

- ${a + 2}$
- ${x^2}$
- ${\sqrt{x} - y}$
- ${\dfrac{x^{1/3} + x^2}{a/b}}$

When we place an equal sign between two expressions, we have an equation:

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

In mathematics, the equal sign is a symbol that expresses the relation
between mathematical objects. In the example above above, these objects are
expressions. When we place an equal sign between two expressions, we are
saying: The expression ${a^2 + b^2}$ is the same, in every way, as the
expression ${c^2.}$ This is a proposition. Notice its gravity. There are
very few things in the world that have that property &mdash; the same in
every way.

We will see in later sections that equality is just one kind of relation.
In fact, a significant portion of mathematics (if not most) concerns
inequations &mdash; propositions like ${x^2 < y^2.}$ We will revisit
inequations (also called inequalities) once we've established familiarity
with equations.
