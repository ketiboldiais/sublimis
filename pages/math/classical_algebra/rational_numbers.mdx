# Rational Numbers

When we divide one integer by another nonzero integer, we get a **rational
number**. Specifically, if, and only if, a number can be written in the
form $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ is an integer and $b$ is a nonzero integer,
then the number is a rational number. For example, 4 is a rational number,
since 4 can be written as $\frac{4}{1}$. 0.5 is a rational number, since it
can be written as $\frac{1}{2}$.
