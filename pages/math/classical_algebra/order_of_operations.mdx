# Order of Operations

Arithmetic allows us to combine numbers, through the operations listed
above, to form other numbers. The way we order operations matters in
mathematics. Otherwise, we run into problems. For example, consider the
following:

$$2 + 3 \times 4$$

What does this expression mean? Well, it could be: (1) Add 2 and 3, then
(2) multiply the sum by 4. Or, it could mean: (1) Multiply 3 and 4, and (2)
add 2 to the product. This ambiguity is unacceptable in mathematics. We
need be clear and precise with our words. For these reason, mathematics
follows a few conventions on how to write mathematical expressions:

1. Evaluate expressions in parentheses first, working from the inner most
   to the outer most, applying the rules below.
2. Perform all exponentiations.
3. Perform all multiplications and divisions from left to right.
4. Perform all additions and subtractions from left to right.

The conventions above are collectively called the **order of operations**.
Again, these are conventions. They are not universal truths; they're simply
what mathematicians have come to agree to about how mathematics is
communicated and understood.

## Operations as Trees

One way to think about the order of operations is that it is a way for us
to distinguish between different "trees" (the diagrams below are called
**binary trees**, to be covered in further detail in later sections). For
example, suppose we had the following expression:

$$2 \times 4 + 6$$

Without the order of operations, the expression above could be
${(2 \times
4)+6}$, which can be visualized as:

Or, it could be $2 \times (4+6)$:

The order of operations tells us that we perform additions and subtractions
from left to right, so the "correct" tree is $(2 \times 4) + 6$, the first
tree. Really, the order of operations is governed by one rule, evaluate
expressions inside the parentheses first, and the remaining rules tell us
_where_ to place parentheses when they are absent. The parentheses, in
turn, allow us to distinguish between different _trees_.
