# Strong Induction

Another kind of proof-by-induction is the **proof-by-strong-induction**.
This is a proof structured according to the _axiom of strong induction_:

> _Axiom: Strong Induction_. Let ${P(n)}$ be any predicate. If ${P(n)}$ is
> true, if ${P(0) \land P(1) \land P(2) \land \ldots \land P(n)}$ are all
> true, then ${P(n+1).}$ More formally:
>
> $$
> 		P(0) \land P(1) \land \ldots \land P(n) \implies P(n+1)
> $$

The only difference between ordinary induction and strong induction is that
with ordinary induction, we are attempting to prove that
${P(n) \implies P(n+1).}$ In strong induction, we are trying to prove that
${P(0) \land \ldots \land P(n) \implies P(n+1).}$ However, he technique is
no different. We are still trying to prove an implication, so we assume
that ${P(n)}$ is true, ${P(n-1)}$ is true, ${P(n-2)}$ is true, all the way
to ${P(0).}$ It is called strong induction because we are allowed to assume
much more that just ${P(n).}$ If we look closely, we wonder if a
proof-by-induction can be done with a proof-by-strong-induction. This is in
fact the case. Any proof-by-induction can be rewritten as a proof-by-strong
induction.

Fair question: Why not use proof-by-strong-induction all the time then?
Because some problems are much easier to solve with an ordinary
proof-by-induction rather than with a proof-by-strong-induction.

To explore how a proof-by-strong-induction looks like, we consider another
game, _stack split_. We start with a stack of 8 blocks. In the first move,
the player must divide the stack into 2 substacks. If the player divides
the stack into 3 and 5, the player receives 15 points: ${3 \times 5.}$ In
the next move, the player divides either substack into 2 substacks. For
example, if the player divides the stack of 5 into 4 and 1, the player
receives 4 points. The player must keep dividing the substacks until they
have 8 stacks of height 1. The last move is dividing a 2-block substack
into 2 substacks of 1 block, returning the player 1 point. The player's
total score is the sum of all points received on each move. The goal:
Obtain the most number of points.

It turns out that no matter how we divide the stacks, the final score will
always be 28. Let's state the proposition:

> _Conjecture._ All strategies for the ${n}$ block game produce the same
> score, ${S(n).}$

Following this conjecture, we saw that ${S(8) = 28.}$ So, let's begin the
proof. First, we state the inductive hypothesis: ${P(n) \coloneqq}$ "All
strategies produce the same score ${S(n).}$" Second, we verify that the
base case is correct. At ${n = 1,}$ the score is 0, since we never made a
move. Thus, ${S(1) = 0.}$ Now we make the inductive step: Assume
${P(1) \land P(2) \land \ldots \land P(n)}$ is true to prove ${P(n+1).}$

Now, given ${n+1}$ blocks, we can split the stack in a stack of ${k}$
blocks or a stack of ${(n + 1)-k}$ blocks, where ${1 \leq k \leq n.}$



The resulting score is ${k(n+1-k).}$ If we split the block of ${k}$ blocks,
then we have ${P(k)}$ points.Thus, the resulting score from spliting ${k}$
blocks is ${k(n+1-k)+P(k).}$ And if we split the ${(n+1)-k}$ stack, we get
${P(n+1-k).}$ Thus, our total score for the game is:

$$
	k(n+1-k) + P(k) + P(n+1-k)
$$

Recall what are trying to prove: The total score just depends on ${n,}$ not
${k.}$ In other words:

$$
	S(n+1) = k(n+1-k) + P(k) + P(n+1-k)
$$

It seems like we're stuck. In every term, there is a ${k.}$ Whenever we're
stuck with inductive proof like this, we want to make a stronger inductive
hypothesis. To make the hypothesis stronger, we want represent ${S(n)}$ as
a formula. This appears to be summing a pattern of numbers, and those
numbers are formed by divisions. But, the formula should work for every
possible way we could divide. The simplest way to divide would be to just
take one stack off at a time, 1 and 7, 1 and 6, 1 and 5, 1 and 4, 1 and 3,
1 and 2, 1 and 1. The resulting score is the sum of ${1 \times 7,}$
${1 \times 6,}$ and so on. More generally, given ${n}$ numbers in order,
this just the sum of ${n-1}$ numbers:

$$
	\dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}
$$

Checking this formula against the base case, it works:
${S(1) = (1(1-1))/2 = 0.}$ So, let's try it on our total score thus far:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		S(n + 1) &= k(n + 1 - k) + \dfrac{k(k - 1)}{2} + \dfrac{(n + 1 - k)(n - k)}{2} \\[1em]
		&= \dfrac{2k(n + 1 - k) + k(k - 1) + (n + 1 - k)(n - k)}{2} \\[1em]
		&= \dfrac{2kn + 2k - 2k^2 + k^2 - k + n^2 + n - kn - kn - k + k^2}{2} \\[1em]
		&= \dfrac{n^2 + n}{2} \\[1em]
		&= \dfrac{n(n + 1)}{2}
	\end{aligned}
$$

It's better than magic. The formula for ${S(n + 1)}$ is
${\dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}.}$ This establishes the stronger hypothesis, thereby
proving that all strategies for an ${n-block}$ game result in the same
score, ${\dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}.}$
