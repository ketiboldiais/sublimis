_Number theory_ is the study of the integers. Despite being one of the
oldest fields in mathematics, there is still a great deal to explore. Many
of those discoveries have widespread implications, most commonly in
cryptography &mdash; the study of hiding numbers.

> _Motivating Problem_. Here is a simple number theory problem: We have two
> jugs, one can only hold 3 gallons, the other can only hold 5 gallons.
> Assume we have an infinite amount of water from a fountain. How do we
> fill one of the jugs with exactly 4 gallons of water using only the two
> jugs?

First, we fill up the 3-gallon jug. Second, we pour all of its water into
the 5-gallon. Third, we fill up the 3-gallon jug again and fill up the
5-gallon. This means exactly 2 gallons can go into the 5-gallon, leaving 1
gallon inside the 3-gallon jug. Fourth, we empty the 5-gallon, and pour the
water inside the 3-gallon into the 5-gallon. Fifth, we fill up the 3-gallon
and pour all of its water into the 5-gallon, which had previously contained
just 1 gallon. We now have 4 gallons.

This is a beautiful solution, but the real wonder is how a small change to
the original problem can drastically change its difficulty. If the 5-gallon
jug were instead a 6-gallon jug, then there would be no solution, since
every pouring would be some multiple of 3.

To understand why this occurs, we should construct a proof for why the
solution works. Before we construct that proof, however, we state a few
basic concepts in number theory.

## The Integers

Number theory is the study of the properties of _integers_. But what is an
integer anyway? A simple question on its face, but is actually pretty
complicated. For starters, there are several definitions we can use:

> _Definition._ A natural number is the difference between two natural
> numbers.

For example, ${3 - 1 = 2,}$ ${1 - 3 = -2,}$ ${1 + 0 = 1,}$ and so on.
Here's another definition:

> _Definition_. An integer is a number with no fractional component.

E.g., ${3}$ is an integer, since ${3}$ has no fractional component.
${3.14,}$ however, is not an integer, since it has the fractional component
${0.14.}$ Here's another definition:

> _Definition_. The set of integers is the set: $$ \{ \ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1,
> 2, \ldots \} $$ denoted ${\Z.}$

In these materials, we'll start by just using the informal and colloquial
definition &mdash; an integer is a number with no fractional component. As
we move along, we'll slowly build on this definition.

## Basic Axioms

Alongside the information definition of the axiom, we also have several
proposition we will just assume to be true. In other words, axioms. The
first is the _Order Axiom_:

> _The Order Axiom_. Where ${~~a,b \in \Z,~~}$ if ${0 < a,~~}$ _and_ >
> ${0 < b}$ then:
>
> $$
> \begin{aligned}
> 	  &a + b > 0,~~ \text{and}\\
> 	  &ab > 0
> \end{aligned}
> $$

From the order axioms, we have the following corollary axioms:

> _Axiom_. If ${a < b}$ and ${b < c,}$ then ${a < c.}$

> _Axiom_. If ${a < b,}$ then ${a + c < b + c}$ and ${a - c < b - c.}$

> _Axiom_. If ${a < b}$ and ${c > 0,}$ then ${ac < bc.}$

> _Axiom_. If ${a < b}$ and ${c < 0,}$ then ${ac > bc.}$

We also have the following axioms related to the integers:

> _Axiom_. If ${~~a, b \in \Z,~~}$ then:
>
> $$
> \begin{aligned}
> 	&a - b \in \Z,~~ \text{and} \\
> 	&ab \in \Z
> \end{aligned}
> $$

> _Axiom_. If ${~~a\in \Z,~~}$ then ${~~\nexists x \in \Z : a < x < a+1}$.

In other words, if ${a}$ is an integer, there is no integer ${x}$ such that
${x}$ is greater than ${a}$ and less than ${a + 1.}$

## Divisibility

Before we discuss divisibility, we should get some terminology out of the
way and refresh our memory on division. Recall that these notations are all
equivalent:

$$
	a/b \space \equiv \space \dfrac{a}{b} \space \equiv \space a \div b \space \equiv \space b \overline{\smash{\footnotesize)}a}
$$

We say that ${a}$ is the **dividend** and ${b}$ is the
**divisor**.[^divisibility_note]

[^divisibility_note]:
    Some fun facts: The horizontal line in long division (an overline), is
    called a _vinculum_. The symbol ${\div}$ is called the _obulus_. The
    forward-slash, as used in division, is called the _solidus_. When used
    with in-line equations (resulting in a longer and slightly less slanted
    forward-slash), it is called the _virgule_. For example:

$$
	15/3 = \dfrac{15}{3} = 15 \div 3 = 3 \overline{\smash{)}15} = 5
$$

Above, ${15}$ is the divisor, and ${3}$ is the dividend. When we divide an
integer by a positive integer, we obtain a **quotient** and a
**remainder**. Remainders are the building blocks for **modular
arithmetic**, a topic we will explore further in the following materials.

When an integer is divided by a nonzero integer, the quotient may or may
not be an integer. For example, ${15/5 = 3.}$ However, ${15/2 = 7.5}$
Suppose ${a}$ and ${b}$ are integers. If ${b / a}$ returns an integer, then
we say &#8220;${a}$ divides ${b.}$&#8221; Knowing this, we introduce a new
definition and notation for division:

> _Notation_. Suppose ${a, b \in \Z,}$ and ${a \neq 0.}$ If ${b/a \in \Z,}$
> then we say that &#8220;${a}$ divides ${b,}$&#8221; denoted:
>
> $$
> 	  a \space\vert\space b
> $$

If ${a \space\vert\space b}$ is true, then ${a}$ is a **factor**, or
**divisor**, of ${b,}$ and ${b}$ is a **multiple** of ${a.}$ Further:

$$
	m \space\vert\space a \iff \exists k \in \Z : (a = k \cdot m)
$$

In other words, ${m \space\vert\space a}$ is true if, and only if, there
exists an integer ${k}$ such that ${a}$ can be written as ${(k)(m).}$

For example, ${3 \space\vert\space 6}$ is true, because 6 can be written as
${(3)(2),}$ and 2 is an integer. Here is an interesting case: If ${a = 0,}$
then any integer ${k}$ will divide ${a.}$ Thus, the proposition
${m \space\vert\space 0}$ is true for all integers.

The definition for divisibility implies several other propositions. We
state these as lemmas:

> _Lemma_. Let ${a, b, c \in \Z.}$ Then:
>
> 1. ${a \space\vert\space b \land a \space\vert\space c \implies a \space\vert\space (b + c)}$
> 2. ${\forall c \in \Z : [(a \space\vert\space b) \implies (a \space\vert\space b \cdot c)]}$
> 3. ${[(a \space\vert\space b) \land (b \space\vert\space c)] \implies (a \space\vert\space c)}$
> 4. ${\forall s, t: [(a \space\vert\space b \land a \space\vert\space c) \implies (a \space\vert\space sb + tc)]}$

Because the lemmas above are so important, let's explore them more
explicitly in words.

> _Lemma_. If ${a}$ divides ${b,}$ and ${a}$ divides ${c,}$ then ${a}$
> divides ${b + c.}$ For example, 2 divides 10 and 20. Following lemma 1, 2
> divides 30.

> _Lemma_. If ${a}$ divides ${b,}$ then ${a}$ divides ${b}$ times ${c,}$
> for any integer ${c.}$ For example, 3 divides 30. It follows that 3
> divides 2(30), or 60.

> _Lemma_. The third lemma: If ${a}$ divides ${b}$ and ${b}$ divides ${c,}$
> then ${a}$ divides ${c.}$[^lemma_three_note]

[^lemma_three_note]:
    E.g., 2 divides 4, and 4 divides 16. It follows that 2 divides 16.

> _Lemma_. If ${a}$ divides ${b}$ and ${a}$ divides ${c,}$ then ${a}$
> divides some **linear combination** ${sb + tc.}$ Example: 3 divides 6 and
> 3 divides 9. It follows that 3 divides the linear combination
> ${6s + 3t.}$

## Quotients & Remainders

We know that division sometimes returns a remainder. This phenomenon is
encapsulated by the **division algorithm**. The division algorithm is not
really an algorithm; it's more so a theorem. Its formal statement:

> _Theorem._ Suppose ${a \in \Z}$ and ${a, b \in \Z^{+}.}$ Then:
>
> $$
> 		\exists q, r \in \Z : (a = dq + r) \land (0 \leq r < d)
> $$

In other words, given two integers ${a,}$ and ${d,}$ ${a}$ and ${d}$ can be
linearly combined into ${a = dq + r,}$ such that ${q}$ and ${r}$ are unique
integers and ${r}$ is greater than or equal to 0 but less than ${d.}$ This
is the formal description of what happens in the long division we performed
in grade school.

In the equality ${a = dq + r,}$ ${a}$ is called the **dividend**, ${d}$ is
called the **divisor**, and ${r}$ is called the **remainder**. We use the
following notation to express these ideas:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	q &= a \text{ div } d \\
	r &= a \bmod d
\end{aligned}
$$

The functions ${\text{ div }}$ and ${\bmod}$ are functions only applicable
to integers. They are what allow us to compute the quotient and the
remainder from integer division separately. For example, consider the
integer ${101.}$ We can express the integer as ${101 = 11 \cdot 9 + 2.}$
Thus, ${101 \text{ div } 11 = 9,}$ and ${101 \bmod 11 = 2.}$

## Modular Arithmetic

A colleague informs us that the next meeting will be 17 days from Tuesday.
What day of the week will this meeting be on? Laying out these days, we and
performing the count we have:

```
Su  Mo  Tu  We  Th  Fr  Sa
0   1   2   3   4
5   6   7   8   9   10  11
12  14  14  15  16  17
```

We see that the day is Friday. We could also have made the same
determination by recognizing that each week consists of 7 unique days,
meaning that the week resets every cycle of 7 days:

```
Su  Mo  Tu  We  Th  Fr  Sa
0   1   2   3   4   5   6
7   8   9   10  11  12  13
14  15  16  17  18  19
```

If we take the index of Tuesday, ${2,}$ and add it to ${17,}$ the number of
days, we get ${19.}$ (${2 + 17 = 19.}$) If we then divided ${19}$ by ${7,}$
we get ${2 \space r 5}$ (2 remainder 5). That 5 is the index of Friday. We
can confirm this approach works by computing 18 days from Tuesday.
${2 + 18 = 20.}$ ${20 / 7 = 2 \space r 6.}$ For 289 days from Tuesday:
${2 + 289 = 291.}$ ${291 / 7 = 41 \space r 4.}$ 4 is the index for
Thursday.

Why does this work? Consider the first example, 17 days from Tuesday. The
sum ${2 + 17 = 19}$ represents the total number of days. When we divide
this by 7, we get back the total number &#8220;complete cycles.&#8221; In
this case, the total number of times we get back to Sunday:
${19 / 7 = 2 \space r 5.}$ The remainder, 5, represents the addition days
we add after Sunday to give us the total number of days. When we add those
days to the index of Sunday, 0, we get the the index of the day of the week
we end on, 5.

Another example: Imagine a clock displaying the time 9:00A.M. If a friend
informs you their flight is in 6 hours, what time do we deduce? Well, we
would deduce, 3:00P.M., by simplying adding the 6 hours. However,
${9 + 6 \neq 3.}$ The fact that we can determine 3:00 P.M. is 6 hours from
9:00 A.M. goes straight to the heart of modular arithmetic.[mod_note]

[^mod_note]:
    9 + 6 = 15. If we used the 24-hour clock, we would quickly determine
    3:00 P.M.

What we're actually doing whenever we add or subtract times on a 12-hour
clock is _arithmetic modular 12_. In the simplest terms, this means that
when we get to the number 12, we start the count again. The numbers
&#8220;wrap around&#8221; like a circle &mdash; exactly like a clock. For
example, if we instead performed addition with **arithmetic modular 3**, we
would go ${1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, \ldots}$ and so on and so forth.
Thus, in arithmetic modular 3, ${1 + 3 = 1.}$ Pretty cool!

How does this tie back to divisibility? Think about the original example,
${9 + 6 = 3.}$ In normal arithmetic, ${9 + 6 = 15.}$ However, within 15 is
a single group of 12. The difference between 15 and 12 &mdash; the
_remainder_ &mdash; is 3. Hence, ${9 + 6 = 3.}$ Clearly, however, we can't
go around saying ${9 + 6 = 3,}$ as most persons do not automatically assume
modular arithmetic. We instead must explicitly write:

$$
	9 + 6 = 3 \bmod 12
$$

Here are a few other examples (think of a clock to confirm):

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		9 + 25 &= 10 \bmod 12 \\
		1 + 17 &= 6 \bmod 12 \\
		8 + 29 &= 1 \bmod 12 \\
		11 + 43 &= 5 \bmod 12 \\
	\end{aligned}
$$

The notation above looks like the remainder operator. In fact, if we
computed ${10 \bmod 12,}$ we would get ${10}$ (since ${10 / 12}$ yields no
remainder).

Now, in regular arithmetic, we might notice that some integers have the
same remainder when we divide them by a positive integer ${m.}$ For
example, ${5 / 2}$ is ${2}$ with a remainder of ${1,}$ and ${9 / 2}$ is
${4}$ with a remainder of ${1.}$ Both ${9}$ and ${5,}$ when divided by the
positive integer ${2,}$ return the same remainder, ${1.}$ In number theory,
we have a special definition for this phenomenon:

> _Definition._ Let ${a}$ and ${b}$ be integers and ${m}$ a positive
> integer. If ${m \space\vert\space a - b,}$ then ${a}$ is congruent to
> ${b}$ modulo ${m.}$ We denote this expression with:
>
> $$
> 		a \equiv b (\bmod \space m)
> $$

The expression ${a \equiv b (\bmod \space m)}$ is a **congruence** and
${m}$ is its **modulus**. If ${a}$ and ${b}$ are not modulo ${m,}$ then we
write:

$$
	a \not\equiv b (\bmod \space m)
$$

To better see what the proposition above communicates, consider our
previous examples, ${9}$ and ${5.}$ Suppose ${a = 9,}$ ${b = 5,}$ and
${m = 2.}$ Thus, ${a - b = 9 - 5 = 4.}$ Given that ${2 \mid 4,}$ it follows
that ${9 \equiv 5(\bmod \space 2).}$

Do not confuse ${a \equiv b(\bmod \space m)}$ with ${a \bmod m = b.}$ The
expression ${a \equiv b(\bmod \space m)}$ provides that ${a}$ is congruent
to ${b}$ modulo ${m.}$ The expression ${a \bmod m = b}$ provides that the
remainder of ${a / m}$ is ${b.}$

While the notations express different ideas, we can see that they are very
closely related. Because ${9 \bmod 2 = 1,}$ and ${5 \bmod 2 = 1,}$ we
conclude that ${9 \equiv 5(\bmod \space 2).}$ More formally:

> _Theorem._ Suppose ${a, b \in \Z}$ and ${m \in \Z^{+}.}$ Then:
>
> $$
> 		[a \equiv b(\bmod \space m)] \iff (a \bmod m = b \bmod m)
> $$

## Proving Our Motivating Problem

Using this idea, **divisibility**, we revisit the jug-filling problem with
more formality. First, let's state our assumptions:

> There is an ${a-}$gallon jug (in the original jug-filling game,
> ${a = 3.}$)

> There is a ${b-}$gallon jug (in the original, ${b = 5}$)

Now let's state our hypothesis:

> If ${m \space\vert\space a}$ and ${m \space\vert\space b,}$ then ${m}$
> should divide any result from pouring, emptying, and filling the jugs.

To prove (or disprove) this hypothesis, we employ a new proving tool. Here,
we want to think of **modeling** this problem. By modeling, we mean
outlining the possible **states** the problem can take. A **state** is
simply the set of all current facts in a problem. This is fairly vague and
abstract, so let's apply the tool. In our problem, we have several states.
First, we have the numbers of gallons in the two jugs. We can denote these
numbers with ordered pairs:

> ${(x, y) \coloneqq}$ the numbers of gallons in the two jugs where,
>
> - ${x \coloneqq}$ the number of gallons in the ${a-}$jug, and
> - ${y \coloneqq}$ the number of gallons in the ${b-}$jug.

We can also define the start state:

> In the start state, there is nothing in each of the jugs. Thus, in the
> start state, the numbers of gallons in the two jugs is ${(0,0).}$

These look like a sufficient number of states, and we can't really think of
anything more useful.[^state_note] Let's now think about the
**transitions** &mdash; the set of all possible ways we can move from one
state to another. One transition is emptying a jug:

[^state_note]:
    When writing proofs, it's often best to write out what comes to mind,
    and if we can't think of anything else immediately, simply move to
    another thought.

> 1. If we empty the ${a-}$ jug, then: ${(x, y) \to (0, y)}$
> 2. If we empty the ${b-}$ jug, then: ${(x, y) \to (x, 0)}$

Another transition is filling.

> Where ${a > x}$ and ${b > y,}$
>
> - If we fill the ${a-}$ jug, then: ${(x, y) \to (a, y).}$
> - If we fill the ${b-}$ jug, then: ${(x, y) \to (x, b).}$

Finally, we have pouring. This is a somewhat more complex transition. Let's
first start with ${(x, y).}$ Let's consider the possibilities. One
possibility is pouring all of the gallons in ${a}$ into all of the gallons
in ${b.}$ Thus:

$$
	(x, y) \to (0, x+y) \implies x+y \geq b
$$

Notice the caveat we appended to the end, ${x+y \geq b.}$ This is because
the ${b}$ jug has a finite amount of space for how many gallons it can
take. For example, if ${b}$ takes only 3 gallons, as was the case in the
original game, then ${x + y \geq 3.}$ Hence, the possibility
${(x, y) \to (0, x+y)}$ can occur only if ${x + y}$ is at most ${b.}$ If
${x + y \geq b}$ is false, then we can only pour some of the contents in
${a}$ into ${b.}$

How do we generalize _some_ gallons? Well, thinking about the start state,
${(x, y).}$ The amount of gallons poured into ${b}$ is ${y.}$ This means
that the amount of gallons poured from ${a}$ into ${b}$ such that ${b}$ is
completely filled is ${b - y.}$ Accordingly:

$$
	(x, y) \to (x - (b - y), b) = (x + y - b, b) \implies x + y \leq b
$$

The caveat in this possibility is ${x + y \leq b.}$ This is the
complementary of the previous caveat. We are within the realm of this
possibility only if there are enough gallons in ${b}$ to pour into ${a.}$

By symmetry, we can list the reverse &mdash; pouring the gallons in ${b}$
into ${a:}$

$$
	(x, y) \to (x + y, 0) \implies x + y \leq 0 \\
	(x, y) \to (a, y - (a - x)) = (a, x + y - a) \implies x + y \leq a
$$

Thus, we now have all the possibilities of pouring:

1. ${(x, y) \to (0, x+y) \implies x+y \geq b}$
2. ${(x, y) \to (x - (b - y), b) = (x + y - b, b) \implies x + y \leq b}$
3. ${(x, y) \to (x + y, 0) \implies x + y \leq 0}$
4. ${(x, y) \to (a, y - (a - x)) = (a, x + y - a) \implies x + y \leq a}$

Let's ensure the propositions we drew above fully describe the original
game.

We have two jugs that can only store a finite amount of gallons: ${a = 3}$
and ${b = 5.}$ Suppose the current number of gallons in the jug is
represented with ${(x, y),}$ where ${x}$ is the number of gallons in the
${a}$ jug, and ${y}$ is the number of gallons in the ${b}$ jug. At the very
start, the jugs are empty: ${(x, y) = (0,0).}$

Then, we fill up the ${b}$ jug:

$$
	(0, 0) \to (0, 5)
$$

We then pour as much of the gallons in the ${b}$ jug into the ${a}$ jug:

$$
	(0, 5) \to (3, 2)
$$

Next, we emptied the ${a}$ jug:

$$
	(3, 2) \to (0, 2)
$$

Then we poured all of the ${b}$ jug into the ${a}$ jug:

$$
	(0, 2) \to (2, 0)
$$

Then we filled the ${b}$ jug:

$$
	(2, 0) \to (2, 5)
$$

After which we poured as much as we would to the ${a}$ jug:

$$
	(2, 5) \to (3, 4)
$$

Given that our state machine accurately describes the original game, we can
now prove our hypothesis:

> If ${m \space\vert\space a}$ and ${m \space\vert\space b,}$ then ${m}$
> should divide any result from pouring, emptying, and filling the jugs.

To construct this proof, we first define an invariant:

> Let P(n) be defined as: If ${(x, y)}$ is the state after ${n}$
> transitions, then ${m \space\vert\space x}$ and
> ${m \space\vert\space y}$.

Now we construct the base case. Here, we want to recall the definition of
divisiblity. ${m \space\vert\space a}$ is true iff there exists an integer
${k}$ such that ${a = (k)(m).}$ In this case, the start state,
${(x, y) = (0,0)}$ complies with our invariant, since ${m}$ divides ${0.}$
Thus, our base case:

$$
	P(0) \coloneqq (0,0) \implies m \space\vert\space 0
$$

We know that ${m \space\vert\space 0}$ is true for all integers, so the
base case, ${P(0)}$ is true. Now we perform the inductive step. Assume
${P(n)}$ is true. We now want to prove that ${P(n + 1)}$ is true. This
amounts to proving, if we move from ${n,}$ a state, to the next state,
${n + 1,}$ the property ${m \space\vert\space x}$ and
${m \space\vert\space y}$ is true.

Suppose ${(x,y)}$ is the state after ${n}$ transitions. Since we suppose
that ${P(n)}$ is true, we know that ${m \space\vert\space x}$ and
${m \space\vert\space y}$ after ${n}$ transitions. Now, we that after a
transition, we have the following possibilities:

1. ${(x, y) \to (0, x+y) \implies x+y \geq b}$
2. ${(x, y) \to (x - (b - y), b) = (x + y - b, b) \implies x + y \leq b}$
3. ${(x, y) \to (x + y, 0) \implies x + y \leq 0}$
4. ${(x, y) \to (a, y - (a - x)) = (a, x + y - a) \implies x + y \leq a}$

More generally, after a transition, each of the jugs are either empty (0),
both jugs are empty (${x}$ and ${y}$), completely filled (${a}$ or ${b}$),
or partially filled (${x + y - b,}$ or ${x + y - a}$). Now, we also know
the following: ${m \space\vert\space 0}$ (by definition),
${m \space\vert\space a}$ (from our base case) and
${m \space\vert\space b}$ (also from our base case). We also know that
${m \space\vert\space x}$ (by ${P(n)}$) and ${m \space\vert\space y}$ (also
from ${P(n)}$). Because ${a,}$ ${b,}$ ${x,}$ and ${y}$ are all divisible by
${m,}$ it follows that the linear combinations ${x + y,}$ ${x + y - a,}$
and ${x + y - b}$ are all divisible by ${m.}$ This fact implies that ${m}$
divides any of the possibilities stated above. This completes the proof.

## Greatest Common Divisor

The **gcd** (greatest common divisor) of numbers ${a}$ and ${b}$ is the
largest number that divides both ${a}$ and ${b.}$ For example,
${gcd(10, 5) = 2.}$ Similarly, ${gcd(18, 12) = 6.}$ With 18 and 12, 3 is a
_common divisor_, but it is not the _greatest_ common divisor.

What is ${gcd(5, 2)?}$ The only divisors of 5 are 1 and 5, and the only
divisors of 2 are 1 and 2. Accordingly, ${gcd(5, 2) = 1.}$ When the
greatest common divisor of two numbers is 1, we say that the numbers are
**relatively prime**.

Recall the theorem we proved above: If ${m \space\vert\space a}$ and
${m \space\vert\space b,}$ then ${m \space\vert\space \text{ any result}.}$
The corollary to this theorem is that the gcd of ${a}$ and ${b}$ divides
any result of our state machine (the jug game).

Let's prove the corollary: Any linear combination, or state, of ${a}$ and
${b,}$ where the linear combination is ${L = sa + tb}$ and
${0 \leq L \leq b,}$ can be reached. For example, if ${s = -2}$ and
${t = 2,}$ then ${L = -2(3) + 2(5) = 4.}$ 4 is a linear combination of
${a}$ and ${b,}$ and we can reach that state through ${n}$ transitions.

When we prove the corollary above, we will want to keep ${s}$ and ${t}$
positive (largely because negative integers can be unwieldy). To keep the
numbers positive, we just have to play around with some natural numbers.
For example, the linear combination ${L = 4}$ can be constructed with
${L = (-2)(3) + (5)(3) + (2)(5) - (3)(5) = (3)(3) - (1)(5) = 4.}$

Let's formalize this trick. Currently, ${L = sa + tb.}$ We can rewrite this
as ${L = (s + mb)a + (t - ma)b.}$ We can then choose an ${m}$ such that
${m > 0.}$ This proves to us that there exists an ${s'}$ and a ${t'}$ such
that L can be rewritten as ${L = s'a + t'b}$ where ${s' > 0.}$ Knowing this
fact, we can write an algorithm that solves the jug problem.

Assume ${0 < L < b.}$ The algorithm will repeatedly fill and pour jugs: To
obtain ${L_{gallons},}$ we repeat ${s'}$ times the following steps:

1. Fill the ${a}$ jug.
2. Pour the ${a}$ jug into the ${b}$ jug.
3. When the ${b}$ jug is full, empty the ${b}$ jug.
4. Continue pouring the ${a}$ jug until the ${a}$ jug is empty.

To see that this works, consider obtaining the 4 gallons. We want the
linear combination ${L = (3)(3) - (1)(5).}$ Accordingly, we must repeat the
process 3 times.

| loop | computation           |
| ---- | --------------------- |
| 1    | ${(0, 0) \to (3, 0)}$ |
| 1    | ${(3, 0) \to (0, 3)}$ |
| 2    | ${(0, 3) \to (3, 3)}$ |
| 2    | ${(3, 3) \to (1, 5)}$ |
| 2    | ${(1, 5) \to (1, 0)}$ |
| 2    | ${(1, 0) \to (0, 1)}$ |
| 3    | ${(0, 1) \to (3, 1)}$ |
| 3    | ${(3, 1) \to (0, 4)}$ |

Let's prove that this algorithm is correct (i.e., prove the corollary). We
know that we must fill the ${a}$ jug ${s'}$ times. Suppose that the ${b}$
jug is emptied ${u}$ times. We do not know how many times we have to empty
the ${b}$ jug, but we will denote it with ${u.}$ Next, let ${r}$ be the
remainder in the ${b}$ jug.

We know that ${0 \leq r \leq b,}$ since ${r}$ is what is left in the ${b}$
jug. Furthermore, we know that ${r = s' \cdot a - u \cdot b.}$ Now, we
assumed that ${0 < L < b.}$ We also know that ${L = s'a + t'b.}$ Thus, we
want to show that ${r = L.}$ Hence:

$$
	\begin{aligned} r &= \overbrace{s'a + t'b}^{L} - t'b - ub \\ &= L - (t' - u)b \end{aligned}
$$

What exactly does ${L - (t' - u)b}$ imply? Well, if ${t' + u \neq 0,}$ then
${r < 0}$ or ${r > b.}$ Now, it cannot be true that ${[r < 0 \lor r > b],}$
since ${0 \leq r \leq b.}$ Because ${[r < 0 \lor r > b],}$ it must be the
case that ${t' + u = 0.}$ Hence, ${u = t'.}$ Because of this fact,
${r = L.}$

The fact that ${r = L}$ leads to a big conclusion. If ${L = 1,}$ we can
express ${L}$ as ${L = 1 = (2)(3) - (1)(5).}$ This means that using our
algorithm above, we can reach any ${L}$ that is a multiple of 1. This
result is generalized through **Euclid's algorithm.**

## Euclid's Algorithm

Euclid's Algorithm is fairly quick way to find the greatest common
denominator (GCD) of two integers. We can state the algorithm in pseudocode
(assume $a$ and $b$ are positive integers).

Here's an iterative version of the algorithm:

<FlowChart data={`
	a[label="a > b?",width=0.8];
	a2[label="no"];
	a1[label="yes"];
	b[label="r := rem(a,b)",width=1.7];
	c[label="a := b"];
	d[label="b := r"];
	e[label="return a",width=1];

    a->a1;
    a1->b;
    b->c;
    c->d;
    d->a->a2->e;

`} width={300} height={300} nodeShape="box"/>

And here is a recursive approach:

<FlowChart
	data={`
	x[label="call gcd(a,b)",width=1.6];
	a[label="r := rem(a,b)",width=1.6];
	b[label="r == 0?",width=1];
	b1[label="yes"];
	b2[label="no"];
	c[label="return b",width=1];
	d[label="return gcd(a=b,b=r)",width=2.4];

    x->a->b;
    b->b1;
    b->b2;
    	b2->d[label="  recurse"];
    	d->x;
    b1->c;

`} width={260} height={260} nodeShape="box" />

A good way to build some intuition for how this algorithm works is to do
some tracing. Let's call it for $a = 255$ and $b = 483:$

| $b > 0$ | $a$ | $b$ | $r$ = $\text{rem}(a,b)$ |
| ------- | --- | --- | ----------------------- |
| true    | 255 | 483 | 255                     |
| true    | 483 | 255 | 228                     |
| true    | 255 | 228 | 27                      |
| true    | 228 | 27  | 12                      |
| true    | 27  | 12  | 3                       |
| false   | 12  | 3   | 0                       |
| false   | --  | --  | return 3                |

To understand _Euclid's algorithm_, we begin with the following
proposition:

> _Theorem._ Suppose that ${a,b \in \Z,}$ and ${b \in \Z^{+}.}$ Then there
> exists a unique quotient ${q,}$ and a remainder ${r}$ of ${a}$ divided by
> ${b}$ such that ${b = qa + r}$ and ${0 \leq r < b.}$

A fairly long theorem, but the key point is that ${r,}$ the remainder, is
always smaller than the divisor. This the foundational premise for why
Euclid's algorithm works. Because the remainder is always smaller than the
divisor, in our algorithm, ${b}$ gets smaller and smaller (since ${b}$ is
assigned the remainder).

We will denote ${r,}$ the remainder, with ${rem(b, a).}$ With this theorem,
we can prove the following lemma:

> _Lemma_. The greatest common denominator of ${a}$ and ${b}$ is the
> greatest common denominator of the remainder of ${b}$ and ${a}$ and
> ${a.}$ I.e.,
>
> $$
> 	  gcd(a, b) = gcd(rem(b, a), a)
> $$

For example, consider the integers 105 and 224. Following the lemma:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		gcd(105, 224) &= gcd(rem(224, 105), 105) \\ &= gcd(14, 105) \\ &= gcd(rem(105, 14), 14) \\ &= gcd(7, 14) \\ &= gcd(rem(14, 7), 7) \\ &= gcd(0, 7) \\ &= 7
	\end{aligned}
$$

Applying the lemma repeatedly, as we did above, is called Euclid's
algorithm. To prove the lemma, we want to show that if
${m \space\vert\space a}$ and ${m \space\vert\space b,}$ then
${m \space\vert\space rem(b,a)}$ and ${m \space\vert\space a.}$

Suppose ${m \space\vert\space a}$ and ${m \space\vert\space b.}$ Then it
must be true that ${m \space\vert\space b - qa}$ and
${m \space\vert\space a.}$ Now we know that ${b - qa = rem(b, a),}$ so it
must be the case that ${m \space\vert\space rem(b, a).}$ This proves that
${gcd(a, b) \space\vert\space gcd(rem(b,a), a).}$ In turn, this implies
that ${gcd(a, b) \leq gcd(rem(b,a), a).}$

Let's now consider the cases. First case: If ${rem(b, a) \neq 0,}$ then
${[m \space\vert\space rem(b - a) = b - qa \land m \space\vert\space a] \implies [m \space\vert\space a \land m \space\vert\space b.]}$
This is because if ${m \space\vert\space a}$ and ${m \space\vert\space b,}$
then ${m}$ divides any linear combination of ${a}$ and ${b.}$

Second case: If ${rem(b, a) = 0,}$ then ${b - qa = 0.}$ We can rewrite
${b - qa = 0}$ as ${b = qa.}$ Thus, if ${rem(b, a) = 0,}$ then ${b = qa.}$
Hence, if ${m \space\vert\space a,}$ then ${m \space\vert\space b.}$

Now, with every algorithm, we must prove that the algorithm is correct. To
do so, the first point we must establish is that the algorithm halts in a
finite amount of time. In this case, it does. The algorithm's inputs get
smaller and smaller, eventually reaching a point where it must halt.

The second point: Resetting the variable values inside the definition of
${gcd()}$ does not change the value of ${gcd(a, b).}$ The proof for this
claim is a little more involved. We're effectively stating:

> For any ${a, b \in \Z^{+},}$ ${gcd(a,b) = gcd(b, rem(a, b)).}$

To begin, recall that ${rem(a, b) \implies a = bq + r,}$ where
${a, b, q, r \in \Z^{+}.}$ Thus, what we want to show is that the largest
integer that divides ${a}$ and ${b}$ is also the largest integer that
divides ${b}$ and ${a = bq + r.}$ Let's state this more explicitly. The
claim we want to prove is the following:

> For all ${a, b, q, r, k \in \Z}$ and ${b \in \Z^{+},}$ if ${a = bq + r}$
> and ${k \space\vert\space a}$ and ${k \space\vert\space b,}$ then
> ${k \text{ div } r.}$

The goal is to reach ${ k \space\vert\space r.}$ Let's begin. First,
suppose that ${a = bq + r,}$ ${k \space\vert\space a,}$ and
${k \space\vert\space b.}$ Since ${k \space\vert\space a,}$ it follows that
${a = kn}$ for some ${n \in \Z.}$ And since ${k \space\vert\space b,}$ it
follows that ${b = km}$ for some ${m \in \Z.}$ We use two different
integers, ${m}$ and ${n,}$ to recognize the possibility that ${a \neq b.}$

Now, examining the conclusion we want to reach, we see
${k \space\vert\space r.}$ Let's apply the same analysis just to see the
possibility. Given that ${k \space\vert\space r,}$ it follows that
${r = kt}$ for some ${t \in \Z.}$ We'll keep this form, ${r = kt,}$ in mind
as we continue.

Next, we know that ${a = bq + r.}$ Rearranging, we have ${r = a - bq.}$ We
know that ${a = kn}$ and ${a = km,}$ so we can rewrite the equation as
${r = kn - (km)q.}$ Factoring out ${k,}$ we have: ${r = k(n - mq).}$ Now
comes the coup de grâce: Let ${t = n - mq.}$ Given that ${n, m, q \in \Z,}$
it follows that ${t}$ must be an integer. It follows that ${r = kt,}$ where
${t}$ is some integer. Therefore, ${k \space\vert\space r.}$

Having proved the second point, we know the algorithm is correct because of
the third point: The return value at the definition's end is correct (i.e.,
${gcd(a, 0) = a}$).

> **Proof**: Every integer ${p}$ divides 0 (i.e., ${0 = (p)(n).}$) When we
> write ${gcd(a, 0),}$ we are asking for the largest integer that divides
> ${a}$ and 0. Because every integer ${p}$ divides 0, the largest integer
> is ${a.}$ Thus, ${gcd(a, 0) = a.}$[^gcd_note]

[^gcd_note]:
    Note that ${gcd(0,0)}$ is undefined. There are many divisors for 0 and
    0, but there is no maximum.

## Application: Encryption

**Encryption** is a method, or process, of hiding objects. We'll start with
a basic scenario. Entities ${A}$ intends to send some message ${m}$ to
${B.}$ ${A,}$ ${B,}$ and ${m}$ could be anyone or anything. ${A}$ and ${B}$
could be people, and ${m}$ is a text message or email. ${A}$ and ${B}$
could be software systems, and ${m}$ is a password or account number.
Either or, when ${A}$ and ${B}$ send the message ${m,}$ there's always the
risk of some entity ${C}$ intercepting the message and finding out what
information it contains.

Encryption is a means of mitigating that risk. Before any substantive
information is exchanged, **keys** are exchanged between ${A}$ and ${B.}$
Based on those keys, some encryption algorithm transforms ${m}$ into
${m'.}$ For now, we can think of ${m'}$ as a "scrambled" &mdash; encrypted
&mdash; version of ${m.}$

Now, when ${m'}$ reaches the recipient, in this case ${B,}$ she uses the
key exchanged with ${A}$ to "unscramble" &mdash; decrypt &mdash; the
message ${m'.}$

Notice how this mitigates the risk. Because ${m'}$ is what actually travels
between ${A}$ and ${B,}$ if ${C}$ intercepts the message, they don't get
${m,}$ they get ${m'.}$ If ${C}$ doesn't have the key for decrypting that
message, they're stuck with ${m',}$ which is essentially nothing more than
a nonsensical sequence of symbols.

With this high-level overview, let's consider what those "scrambling"
algorithms are (more formally called _encryption schemes_).

## Encryption Scheme: Turing Code 1

The first encryption scheme we consider is one that might have been made by
the computer scientist Alan Turing. Turing was the first to propose using
number theory for encryption, but his ideas were never published (hence the
"might have been made" in the previous sentence).

For example, consider the string `"victory"`. We can represent each letter
in this string with an integer corresponding to its index in the Latin
alphabet sequence. For example, the letter `v` is the twenty-second letter
of the alphabet, `i` is the ninth, `c` is the third, and so on. Mapping all
the letters to their indices:

<Sequence data={["v", "i", "c", "t", "o", "r", "y"]} />

It turns out that if we pack all of the numbers together:

$$
	22090320151825
$$

then just insert a ${13}$ at the end:

$$
	22090320151825\textcolor{indianred}{13}
$$

we get a prime number. Using this example, we can construct a simple
encryption scheme. The procedure:
