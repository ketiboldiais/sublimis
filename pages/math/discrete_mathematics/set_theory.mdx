There are two versions of set theory: (1) **naive set theory**, and (2)
**axiomatic set theory**. We explore aspects of both theories in the
materials that follow. What are the differences? Naive set theory is the
version of set theory as originally constructed by the German mathematician
Georg Cantor.[^cantor_note] Axiomatic set theory is the version of set
theory constructed in response to several paradoxes, the most famous of
which is _Russell's Paradox_. Axiomatic set theory itself consists of
several versions—_Zermelo set theory_ and _Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory_.
The paradoxes these more modern theories attempted to resolve will appear
as we explore the basic concepts of naive set theory.

[^cantor_note]:
    When Cantor first introduced set theory, the math community largely
    ridiculed him. Over time, however, the theory gained big-name
    mathematicians like David Hilbert. Nevertheless, the ridicule remained
    and affected Cantor deeply. Comments at the time captured the split:
    David Hilbert famously said, "No one will drive us from the paradise
    which Cantor created for us." To which Wittgenstein&mdash;a philosopher
    and one of Hilbert's most formidable opponents&mdash;responded, "If one
    person can see it as a paradise of mathematicians, why should not
    another see it as a joke?"

In mathematics, a **set** is a collection of objects. Those objects might
be dogs, people, trees, numbers, values, variables, or more abstractly,
propositions. For example, the set of all coins includes nickels, sterling,
and yen. The set of all countries includes Japan, Palau, and Uruguay. The
set of all integers includes 1 and -117. We can visualize a set as:

<Fig

	}
	caption={"Basic sets"}
	width={"40"}
	imwidth={"239"}
	imheight={"95"}
/>

Sets can be finite (there are only so many countries), or infinite (there
are infinitely many of numbers). Each object in a set is called a
**member** of that set.

We say that a set is **well-defined** if, for any given ${x,}$ we can
determine whether ${x}$ is a member of the set. For example, the set
${L = \{x \in \R \mid x > 4\}}$ is a well-defined set. Given any ${x,}$ we
can determine whether ${x}$ is a member of ${L.}$ ${x}$ must be a real
number, and it must be greater than 4. The set
${G = \{ 1, 4, 3, 9, \pi, \ldots \},}$ however, is not a well-defined set.
Is ${3.2}$ a member of ${G?}$ We do not have enough conditions to make a
determination.

The elements of a set do not have any inherent order. For example, the set
$\{ 1, 2, 3 \}$ is the same as the set $\{ 2, 1, 3 \}$, and the same set as
$\{ 2, 2, 3, 1 \}$. The **axiom of extension** provides that a set is
completely determined by what its elements are—it is irrelevant whether the
elements are in order, or whether an element is listed more than once.

## Subsets

Some sets are themselves elements of another set. These sets are called
**subsets**.[^subsets_note] For example, the set of all Herefords is a
subset of the set of all cows, and the set of all bonobos is a subset of
the set of all great apes. More formally:

[^subsets_note]:
    A set consisting of only one member is called a **singleton**.

> _Definition_. Suppose ${A}$ and ${B}$ are sets. The set ${A}$ is a
> _subset_ of ${B}$ if, and only if, _every_ element of ${A}$ is also an
> element of ${B.}$ To denote this relationship, we write:
>
> $$
>   A \subseteq B
> $$
>
> If $A$ is not a subset of $B$, then we write:
>
> $$
>  A \nsubseteq B
> $$

If ${A \subseteq B}$ is true, then we can infer: For every element ${x,}$
if ${x \in A,}$ then ${x \in B.}$ We describe ${A}$ and ${B's}$
relationship with statements such as "${A}$ is contained in $B$" and "${B}$
contains ${A.}$"

$$
  A \subseteq B \iff \forall x(x \in A \implies x \in B)
$$

If $A \nsubseteq B$ is true, then we can infer: There is at least one
element $x$ such that $x \in A$ and $x \notin B$. In other words, if $A$ is
not a subset of $B$, then there is at least one element in $A$ that is not
an element of ${B.}$

From the definition above, if we are asked to prove that ${A}$ is a subset
of ${B,}$ we must show that if ${x}$ belongs to ${A,}$ then ${x}$ also
belongs to ${B.}$ If we are asked to prove that ${A}$ is _not_ a subset of
${B,}$ we must find a single ${x}$ that belongs to ${A}$ but does not
belong to ${B.}$

The definition above implies that the empty set is a subset of all sets,
and a given set is a subset of itself. In other words, for the set ${A,}$
the sets ${\varnothing}$ and ${A}$ are subsets of ${A.}$ We say that ${A}$
and ${\varnothing}$ are **trivial subsets** of ${A.}$

This follows directly from the definition. The proposition
${\varnothing \subseteq A}$ if, for all ${x \in \varnothing,}$ ${x \in A.}$
Because the sufficient condition, ${x \in \varnothing}$ is false, it
follows that ${x \in A}$ is true. This is an example of a **vacuous
proof**.

The case of ${A \subseteq A}$ straightforward. Given that ${A}$ and ${A}$
are the same sets, every ${x \in A}$ implies that ${x \in A.}$ Because the
sufficient condition is true and the necessary condition is true, it
follows that ${A \subseteq A}$ by definition.

### Proper Subsets

If a subset ${B}$ of ${A}$ is such that ${B \neq A}$ and
${B \neq \varnothing,}$ then we say that ${B}$ is called a proper subset of
${A.}$ For example, the set of all potatoes is a subset of all root
vegetables. It certainly isn't empty—you've got Yukon Golds, Russet
potatoes, Japanese sweet potatoes, LaRette potatoes, and so on. But it also
doesn't comprise the entire set of all root vegetables either, because
there are other root vegetables: taro, yams, tapioca, turmeric, ginseng,
ginger, beets, and so on. Thus, we say that, "Potatoes are a proper subset
of root vegetables," and write:
${\text{taro} \subset \text{root vegetables}.}$

$$
 A \subset B \iff [\forall x(x \in A \implies x \in B) \land \exists x (x \in B \land x \notin A)]
$$

A subset is a general concept. When we say that ${A}$ is a "subset" of
${B,}$ we allow the possibility of ${A}$ and ${B}$ being equal. For
example, the set of all aardvarks is a subset of all Orycteropodidae, and
the set of all Orycteropodidae is a subset of all Tubulidentata. However,
aardvarks comprise all the members of Orycteropodidae, and Orycteropodidae
comprise all the members of Tubulidentata. Thus, these sets are all equal,
but are also subsets.[^bio_note]

[^bio_note]:
    In biology, a taxon (an instance of a taxonomy level, e.g., kingdom,
    phylum, class, etc.) with only one superset is called **monotypic**.
    Aardvarks, the Albany pitcher plant, the hyacinth macaw, among others
    are all monotypic.

Now, if some extinct species of Orycteropodidae comes back to life or some
new species is discovered, then the aardvarks would not comprise all of
Orycteropodidae. In that situation, aardvarks are no longer _just_ a subset
of Orycteropodidae. We can still refer to aardvarks as a subset of
Orycteropodidae, but we are now also permitted to more specifically say
that aardvarks are a **proper subset** of Orycteropodidae.

> _Definition_. Suppose ${A}$ and ${B}$ are sets. ${A}$ is a **proper
> subset** of ${B}$ if, and only if, every element of ${A}$ is in ${B,}$
> but there is at least one element in $B$ that is not in $A$. If $A$ is a
> proper subset of $B$, we write:
>
> $$
>   A \subset B
> $$

If ${A \subset B}$ is true, we can infer: All of the elements of ${A}$ are
elements of $B$, but there is at least one element of ${B}$ that is not an
element of ${A.}$ We can also infer that all the elements of ${A}$ have
some property in common that separate it from other subsets of ${B.}$

A helpful way to distinguish between the two symbols is noticing how they
share similarities to the symbols ${\leq}$ and ${<.}$ ${\subseteq }$ means
"subset or equal" and ${\subset}$ means "subset but not equal;" the former
is more general than the latter.

If $A \subset B$ is false (i.e., $A$ is not a proper subset of $B$), we
write:

$$
 A \not\subset B
$$

If $A \not\subset B$ is true, then either $A \not\subseteq B$ is true, or
$A \subseteq B$ is true, but no elements in $B$ are not in $A$.

## Classes

A set, or collection, of sets is called a **class of sets**. For example,
the class of all undergraduate students includes the sets of freshmen,
sophomores, juniors, seniors, super-seniors. The class of English sentences
includes the sets of declarative, interrogative, imperative, and
exclamative sentences.

> _Definition_. A set whose members are sets is called a **class**.

We generally denote classes with fancy script letters: ${\mathscr{A},}$
${\mathscr{B},}$ ${\mathscr{C},}$ etc.

Some classes have a special property where a member set of the class is
associated, or defined, in terms of a particular index. For example, the
set ${\Z^{+}}$ can be viewed as a class, whose member sets are the positive
even integers and the positive odd integers. Moreover, ${\Z^{+}}$ itself is
defined in terms of a larger class—the set of integers ${\Z.}$ This larger
class is called the **index set** of the class of positive integers.

> _Definition_. A class ${\mathscr{C}}$ is called an **indexed class** if
> there exists a set ${S}$ such that for each element ${i \in S,}$ there
> exists a unique member ${A_i}$ in ${\mathscr{C}}$ associated with ${i}$
> and ${\mathscr{C} = \{ A_i : i \in S \}.}$ In this case, the set ${S}$ is
> called the **index set**.

## The Empty Set

> "All of my friends laugh at my jokes about vacuous truths."

Some sets have no members. For example, the set of all positive integers
greater than their squares is the empty set. If there is even a single
element in the set, then the set is not the empty set. Such a set (a set
with a single member) is called a **singleton**. Do not confuse the lack of
an element with the lack of a subset. The empty set does have a subset—the
empty set. But the fact that it has a subset does not imply that it has an
element. We will see why this is the case shortly.

The empty set is both an interesting and useful concept to have. Proferred
by George Boole, the empty set embodies the concept of _nothingness_.
Nothingness is a difficult concept to think about, but as with many things
in mathematics, the idea is encapsulated—abstracted away—into a single
symbol: ${\varnothing.}$ The abstraction allows us to reason about
nothingness differently. Usually, when we think of filling an empty pint
with beer, we tend to think that we are somehow negating the glass's
emptiness; sort of "removing" the nothingness inside the pint.
${\varnothing,}$ however, is a member of every set except itself. We cannot
remove nothingness from the set of all natural numbers—it's always there.

Importantly, the empty set is a common source of mistakes among novices.
First, we always denote the empty set with the null symbol:
${\varnothing.}$ At no point do we ever write:

$$
 \{ \}
$$

This is equivalent to a spelling mistake in mathematics. Second, the set
containing an empty set is _not_ the same as the empty set:

$$
 \varnothing \neq \{ \varnothing \}
$$

Once more, these are two very different things. One is an actual object
(${\varnothing}$), the other is a box containing a single object
(${\{ \varnothing \}}$). The empty set can be thought of as representing an
empty folder. If we place an empty folder ${A}$ inside an empty folder
${B,}$ then the folder ${A}$ is no longer empty: It contains a folder. The
distinction between elements and subsets is a critical distinction. Think
of it this way: There's a meaningful difference between giving someone a
beautifully wrapped present with nothing inside, and a beautifully wrapped
present with something inside.

### Vacuous Truth

The empty set offers an opportunity to revisit the notion of **vacuous
truth**. Here's the question: Suppose we had a set ${A.}$ Is the empty set
a subset of ${A?}$ The tempting answer is "It depends. What's in ${A?}$"
Unfortunately, the temptation is wrong—it does not depend. Recall the
definition of a subset:

$$
 B \subseteq A \space \iff \space \forall x(x \in B \implies x \in A)
$$

The key point to consider is the condition ${x \in B.}$ Now substitute
${B}$ with ${\varnothing.}$ Is the statement ${x \in \varnothing}$ true? Of
course not. The empty set is empty—there's nothing in it. This means that
the sufficient condition for the definition of a subset is always false
when we consider the empty set as a subset. And what happens when a
sufficient condition is false? The conditional proposition is always true!
This is a vacuous truth: The empty set is a subset of ${A.}$ In fact, the
empty set is a subset of every set, including itself (since the condition
is still false if we substitute ${A}$ with ${\varnothing}$).

The notion of vacuous truth may seem strange, but it follows directly from
logic. Consider the negation of the definition for a subset:

$$
 B \nsubseteq A \space \iff \space \exists x(x \in B \land x \notin A)
$$

In other words, ${B}$ is not a subset of ${A}$ if there's an ${x}$ in ${A}$
that's not in ${B.}$ We know there's nothing in the empty set, so there can
never be an ${x}$ in ${B}$ that's not in ${A.}$ There are no ${xs}$ to
begin with.

This discussion leads to some helpful points regarding proofs concerning
sets:

1. To prove that ${A \subseteq B,}$ show that ${A}$ and ${B}$ are just
   trenchcoats: If ${x}$ is inside ${A,}$ then ${x}$ is also inside ${B.}$

2. To prove that ${A \nsubseteq B,}$ find a culprit: There's at least one
   ${x}$ inside ${A}$ that's not inside ${B.}$

3. If we think a little more carefully about the definition for subsets,
   we'd realize that this whole idea of the empty set being a subset of
   itself extends to a more general conclusion:

> _Theorem_. For every set ${S:}$
>
> $$
> \begin{aligned}
>   &\varnothing \subseteq S ~~\text{and}
>   &S \subseteq S
> \end{aligned}
> $$

Why is this true? Well, we know that since ${\varnothing}$ has no members,
the sufficient condition for the definition of a subset is always false, so
it follows that ${\varnothing \subseteq S}$ is always true. Next, by the
law of identity, every statement implies itself. Thus,
${x \in S \implies x \in S.}$ This implies that every element of ${S}$ is
an element of ${S.}$ And since every element of ${S}$ is an element of
${S,}$ it follows that ${S \subseteq S.}$

## Set Notation

To more efficiently discuss sets, mathematicians have come up with **set
notation**. Let's go over some of the most common notation.

> _Definition_. Suppose that ${S}$ is a set. The notation ${x \in S}$ means
> "${x}$ is an element of ${S}$."

A set may be made more explicit through **set roster notation**. For
instance, $\{ 0, 1, 2 \}$ is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 2. If
the set has too many elements to list, ellipses may be used. For example,
the set of all integers from 0 to 100 may be written as:
$\{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots , 100 \}$. Likewise, the set of all positive integers
may be written as $\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}$.

We can also specify sets in **set builder notation**. Suppose that $S$ is a
set, and $P(x)$ is a property that elements of $S$ may or may not satisfy.
We can define a new set that contains all the elements of $S$ such that
$P(x)$ is true:

$$
 \{ x \in S \mid P(x) \}
$$

The pipe character, |, is shorthand for "such that." Thus, above notation
refers to all the elements of ${S}$ with the property $P(x)$. Note that in
some mathematical contexts, the phrase "such that" is often abbreviated
"s.t." or $\ni$. Thus, the above set may appear in some texts as:

$$
 \{ x \in S \ni P(x) \}, \space \text{or} \\[1em] \{ x \in S \text{ s.t. } P(x) \}
$$

As an exercise, consider the following problem:

> _Problem_. What are all the subsets and proper subsets of
> ${\{ 1, 2, 3 \}?}$

Listing all of the subsets are:

<div>
<div>
 ${\{ 1, 2, 3 \}}$
 ${\{ 1, 2 \}}$
 ${\{ 1, 3 \}}$
 ${\{ 2, 3 \}}$
</div>
<div>
 ${\{ 1 \}}$
 ${\{ 2 \}}$
 ${\{ 3 \}}$
 ${\varnothing}$
</div>
</div>

Of these subsets, are proper subsets except for ${1,2,3.}$

### Intervals

We might recall from calculus the need to define domains and ranges. For
example, the function ${f(x) = \sin x}$ has a domain of ${\R,}$ and a range
of ${-1 \leq f(x) \leq 1.}$ The range can alternatively be written as
${[1, -1].}$ Or, in _Bourbaki notation_, ${]1,-1[.}$ This notation
inherently represents a set:

$$
 [-1, 1] = \{ f(x) : -1 \leq f(x) \leq b \}
$$

Why a set? Because intervals are in fact sets. Formally:

> _Definition_. An interval is a subset ${I}$ of ${\R,}$ i.e.,
> ${I \subset R,}$ such that:
>
> $$
>  (x < y < z) \land (x, z \in I) \implies y \in I
> $$

From this definition, we can see how the intervals we encounter in other
mathematical fields translate to sets:

- ${(a, b) = \{ x \in \R : a < x < b \}}$
- ${(a, b] = \{ x \in \R : a < x \leq b \}}$
- ${[a, b) = \{ x \in \R : a \leq x < b \}}$
- ${[a, b] = \{ x \in \R : a \leq x \leq b \}}$

## Set Identity

Consider the following sets:

$$
 A = \{ 1, 2, 3 \}\\ B = \{ 3, 2, 1 \}\\ C = \{ 2, 1, 3 \}
$$

By the axiom of extension, ${A,}$ ${B,}$ and ${C}$ all have the same
elements. Observing this, we have the following definition:

> _Definition_. Two sets ${A}$ and ${B}$ are **identical** if, and only if,
> every element of ${A}$ an element of ${B,}$ and every element of ${B}$ is
> an element of ${A.}$
>
> $$
>    A = B \iff \forall x(x \in A \iff x \in B)
> $$

From the definition above, given to sets ${A}$ and ${B,}$ to prove that
${A}$ is equal to ${B,}$ we prove that ${A \subseteq B}$ and
${B \subseteq A.}$ In other words, we must prove the following
propositions:

> ${\forall x(x \in A \implies x \in B)}$ >
> ${\forall x(x \in B \implies x \in A)}$

## 1-to-1 Correspondence

When Oliver Twist asked for more gruel, the master grew pale and aimed a
blow at Oliver's head. Why? Because at meal time, each child was to receive
one, and only one, serving of gruel. Suppose each boy is a member of the
set ${\text{workers},}$ and each serving of gruel is a member of the set
${\text{servings}.}$ Then, each element of ${\text{workers}}$ gets one, and
only one, element of ${\text{servings}.}$ In mathematics, we call this
**1-to-1 correspondence**.

> _Definition_. Let ${A = \{ a_1, a_2, \cdot, a_n \}}$ and
> ${B = \{ b_1, b_2, \cdot, b_n \}.}$ Sets ${A}$ and ${B}$ are in _1-to-1
> correspondence_ if there exists a pairing of the elements of ${A}$ to the
> elements of ${B,}$ such that each ${a}$ corresponds to one and only one
> ${b,}$ and each ${b}$ corresponds to one and only one ${b.}$

## Cardinality

Suppose we have the following set, called ${A:}$

$$
 \{ a, b, c, d \}
$$

How many elements are in this set? There are 4. The number of elements in a
set is called the set's **cardinality**. The term _cardinality_ is derived
from the term _cardinal number_ (a number used for counting, rather than
ordering). Cardinality plays a special role in both mathematics and
programming. For example, in computer science, an **uncountable function**
is a function where no computer program can be written to find all its
values. In other words, there are some functions that we, as programmers,
cannot write simply because the _cardinality_ of the function's set of
outputs is either too large to count or cannot be counted at all.

> _Definition_. Given a set ${A,}$ if there are exactly ${m}$ elements in
> ${A,}$ where ${m \in \N,}$ then ${A}$ is a _finite set_ with a
> _cardinality_ of ${m.}$ We denote this fact with:
>
> $$
>   n(A) = m
> $$

The notation ${n(A)}$ is not the only one way to denote cardinality. Some
texts denote cardinality with ${\lvert A \rvert }$ and ${\text{card}(A) .}$
We use ${n(A),}$ but will switch notations as necessary for clarity. Note
that when analyzing cardinality, the axiom of extension applies. The set
${A = \{ 1, 1, 2 \}}$ and ${B = \{ 1, 2 \}}$ are the same sets. Thus, both
${A}$ and ${B}$ have a cardinality of 2 (i.e., ${n(A) = n(B) = 2.}$)

Another useful fact when handling cardinality: The empty set is the only
set with a cardinality of 0:

> _Definition_. Given a set ${A,}$ if ${n(A) = 0,}$ then ${A}$ is the empty
> set, ${\varnothing.}$

Further note that because sets denote the number of elements in a set, for
our purposes, we follow the axiom that cardinality can never be
negative.[^neg_note] Because we're discussing set algebra, we are careful
to state this axiom explicitly:

[^neg_note]:
    Negative cardinality is a concept explored in modern mathematics, but
    it is beyond the scope of these materials.

> _Definition_. Given a set ${A,}$ ${n(A) \geq 0.}$

### Comparing Cardinalities

When we study functions later, we'll see that a critical trait of functions
is whether they are one-to-one. Such functions are called _injective
functions_. This classification is governed by the notion of two sets,
${A}$ and ${B,}$ having the same cardinality.

> _Definition_. Let ${A}$ and ${B}$ be sets. ${A}$ and ${B}$ have the same
> cardinality if, and only if, there is a one-to-one correspondence from
> ${A}$ to ${B.}$ If ${A}$ and ${B}$ have the same cardinality, we write
> ${n(A) = n(B).}$

More generally, we can compare the cardinalities of sets with the classical
comparison operators. For example, when we write ${n(A) < n(B)}$, we are
stating, "Set ${A}$ is smaller than set ${B.}$" When we write
${n(A) \geq n(B),}$ we are stating, "Set ${A}$ is smaller or the same size
as set ${B.}$"

### Countable Sets

Careful thought into sets reveals that there are some sets we can't count.
For example, intuitively, we might think that because there are infinitely
many integers, there are infinitely many odd positive integers, so we
simply can't count all of the odd positive integers. This intuition,
however, is wrong. Why? Because mathematics has a very strict definition of
"countable":

> _Definition_. A set ${A}$ is _countable_ iff:
>
> 1. ${A}$ is finite; or
> 2. ${n(A) = n(\Z^{+})}$

Otherwise, ${A}$ is _uncountable._ If ${A}$ is an infinite set and
countable, we denote the cardinality of ${A}$ by writing
${n(A) = \alef_0,}$ and say that ${A}$ has cardinality "aleph null."

Based on this definition, we can see that the set of odd positive integers,
${\Z_{\text{odd}},}$ is a countable set. Why? Well consider the function
${f(n) = 2n - 1,}$ where ${n \in \Z^{+}.}$ This function maps the set of
positive integers to the set of odd numbers. Now, recall the definition for
when two sets are considered equal. They are equal iff there is a
one-to-one correspondence between ${\Z^{+}}$ and ${\Z_{\text{odd}}.}$ Two
sets have one-to-one correspondence if they are both (a) one-to-one and (b)
onto.

The first requirement, (a), is satisfied. Suppose that ${f(n) = f(m).}$
From this assumption, it follows that ${2n - 1 = 2m - 1.}$ It then follows
that ${n = m.}$ This proves that the set is onto.

The second requirement, (b), is satisfied. Let's say there's some odd
positive integer ${s.}$ Since ${s}$ is an odd positive integer, it is a
positive integer of the form ${2k - 1,}$ where ${k \in \Z^{+}.}$ This in
turn means that ${s}$ will always be less than an even positive integer
${2k.}$ As such, it follows that ${s = 2k - 1 = f(k).}$ And given this
fact, no ${s,}$ an odd positive integer, can map to even integer. It
follows then that the odd positive integers will always map to the positive
integers.

Satisfying both (a) and (b), the function ${f}$ is a one-to-one
correspondence from ${\Z^{+}}$ to ${\Z_{\text{odd}}.}$ And because it is of
one-to-one correspondence, it follows that
${n(\Z_{\text{odd}}) = n(\Z^{+}).}$ This satisfies the definition of
countability above—the set of odd positive integers is countable.

## Foundational Operations

Suppose there exists a set ${A.}$ If an entity or discrete mathematical
object ${a}$ belongs to ${A,}$ we write ${a \in A}$ (read "${a}$ is an
element of ${A}$"). If ${a}$ does not belong to ${A}$, we write
${a \notin A}$ (read "$a$ is not an element of ${A}$"). If the set ${A}$
has no elements, then it is the empty set ${\varnothing}$, and we write
${A = \varnothing.}$

Sets can be alluded to verbally, in set roster notation (where all its
elements are individually listed), or in set notation (where the set is
described in general). For example, the following sets are all identical:

- "The set of all integers whose square is between, and includes, one and

### Set Union

> ${A \cup B = \{ x \mid x \in A \lor x \in B \}}$

Suppose there are two sets, $A$ and $B$. The **union** of $A$ and $B$,
denoted ${A \cup B,}$ is the set of all elements of both $A$ and $B$.

A **Venn diagram**. Venn diagrams are named after the English mathematician
John Venn, who introduced their usage in 1881. More formally:

> _Definition_. Given sets ${A}$ and ${B,}$ ${A \cup B}$ is the set of all
> elements in either ${A,}$ ${B,}$ or both ${A}$ and ${B.}$

#### Cardinality of Unions

Working with set theory, knowing the size of a union is tremendously
useful. However, we must be careful when counting the elements. Because
${A \cup B}$ consists of all the elements in ${A,}$ ${B,}$ and the elements
in both ${A}$ and ${B,}$ the elements in both ${A}$ and ${B}$ are counted
twice. Accordingly, we must subtract the intersection of ${A}$ and ${B}$ to
retrieve the correct cardinality. This is called the **principle of
inclusion-exclusion**:

> _Principle of Inclusion-exclusion_. Given ${A \cup B,}$
>
> $$
>   n(A \cup B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \cap B)
> $$

### Set Intersection

The intersection of two sets ${A}$ and ${B}$ is set of elements that are
(1) members of ${A}$ and ${2}$ also members of ${B.}$ This is a deceptively
simple definition. For example, ${\{ 1, 2, 3 \} \cap \{ 2, 3, 4 \}}$ very
clearly yields the intersection ${\{ 2, 3 \}.}$ But here's a slighly more
devilish one: ${\{ 1, 2, 3 \} \cap \{ 3, 4, 5 \}.}$ It's very tempting to
say 3. The correct answer, however, is ${\{ 3 \}.}$ The slip is forgetting
the fact that the intersection operation _always_ returns a set.

$$
 A \cap B = \{ x \mid x \in A \land x \in B \} \\ (A \cap B = \varnothing) \implies disjoint(A, B)
$$

Given two sets $A$ and $B$, the **intersection** of $A$ and $B$, denoted
${A \cap B,}$ is the set of all elements in both $A$ and $B$. Visually:

<Fig
	link={
		"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1653359232/math/A_intersect_B_gha4ac.svg"
	}
	caption={"The intersection of A and B"}
	width={"40"}
	imwidth={"81"}
	imheight={"61"}
/>

We say that two sets, ${A}$ and ${B,}$ are **disjoint** if, and only if,
${A \cap B = \varnothing.}$

### Cardinalities of Intersections and Unions

Suppose we had the following sets ${A}$ and ${B:}$

$$
 \begin{aligned} A &= \{ 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 14, 22 \} \\ B &= \{ 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13 \} \end{aligned}
$$

As a Venn diagram, sets ${A}$ and ${B}$ are visualized as such:

<Fig
	link={
		"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1653359316/math/cardinality_intersection_mp0b1m.svg"
	}
	caption={"An explicit intersection"}
	width={40}
	imwidth={314}
	imheight={220}
/>

We see that the union of ${A}$ and ${B}$ is:

$$
 A \cup B = \{ 5, 2, 11 \}
$$

The cardinalities of the sets and the union:

$$
 \begin{aligned} n(A) &= 8 \\ n(B) &= 9 \\ n(A \cup B) &= 14 \\ n(A \cap B) &= 3 \end{aligned}
$$

Notice that the cardinality of the union is not simply ${n(A) + n(B).}$
This is because simply adding ${n(A)}$ and ${n(B)}$ results in counting the
elements in the intersection twice. Accordingly, to compute the cardinality
of ${A \cup B,}$ we must subtract ${A \cap B.}$ This yields the following
formula:

> _Formula_. Let ${A}$ and ${B}$ be non-empty, finite sets. The cardinality
> of ${A \cup B}$ is given by the formula:
>
> $$
>    n(A \cup B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \cap B)
> $$

From the above formula, we can derive a second formula for the cardinality
of the intersection:

> _Formula_. Let ${A}$ and ${B}$ be non-empty, finite sets. The cardinality
> of ${A \cap B}$ is given by the formula:
>
> $$
>  n(A \cap B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \cup B)
> $$

### Set Difference

Let $A$ and $B$ both be sets. The difference of $A$ and $B$, denoted
${A \setminus B}$ (read "$A$ set minus $B$) is the set of all elements in
$A$ and not in $B.$ In other words,
${A \setminus B = \{ x : (x \in A) \land (x \notin B) \}.}$

	}

/>

More formally:

> _Definition: Set Difference_. Given sets ${A}$ and ${B,}$ >
> ${A \setminus B}$ is the set containing all the elements in ${A}$ that
> are not contained in ${B.}$

We say that ${A \setminus B}$ is the **complement** of ${B}$ with respect
to ${A.}$

### Complements

The complement of a set ${S}$ more generally refers to the set of all
elements not contained in ${S.}$ If we have a defined universal set ${U}$
and ${A \subset U,}$ then the complement of ${A}$ is the set of all
elements in ${U}$ that are not inside ${A.}$

> _Definition: Complement_. Suppose ${U}$ is the universal set. The
> complement of the set ${A,}$ denoted ${\overline{\rm A},}$ is the
> _complement_ of ${A}$ with respect to ${U.}$ Hence:
>
> $$
>   \overline{\rm A} = U \setminus A
> $$
>
> Or, alternatively:
>
> $$
>    \overline{\rm A} = U - A
> $$

#### Set Identities

Knowing the set operations, it's often helpful to know several _set
identities_ by heart to quickly perform deductions. These identities are
presented below:

| Name                | Identity                                                             |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Identity Law 1      | ${A \cap U = A}$                                                     |

| Domination Law 2    | ${A \cap \varnothing = \varnothing}$                                 |
| Indempotent Law 1   | ${A \cup A = A}$                                                     |
| Indempotent Law 1   | ${A \cap A = A}$                                                     |
| Complementation Law | ${\overline{\rm (\overline{\rm A})} = A}$                            |
| Commutative Law 1   | ${A \cup B = B \cup A}$                                              |
| Commutative Law 2   | ${A \cap B = B \cap A}$                                              |
| Associative Law 1   | ${A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup C}$                            |
| Associative Law 2   | ${A \cap (B \cap C) = (A \cap B) \cap C}$                            |
| Distributive Law 1  | ${A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)}$                   |
| Distributive Law 2  | ${A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)}$                   |
| De Morgan's Law 1   | ${\overline{\rm A \cap B} = \overline{\rm A} \cup \overline{\rm B}}$ |

| Absorption Law 1    | ${A \cup (A \cap B) = A}$                                            |
| Absorption Law 2    | ${A \cap (A \cup B) = A}$                                            |
| Complement Law 1    | ${A \cup \overline{\rm A} = U}$                                      |
| Complement Law 2    | ${A \cap \overline{\rm A} = \varnothing}$                            |

### Symmetric Difference

The **symmetric difference** between two sets ${A}$ and ${B}$ is defined
as:

$$
 A \Delta B = (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A)
$$

That is to say, the symmetric difference of sets ${A}$ and ${B}$ is the set
made up of all the elements which are in ${A}$ or ${B}$ but not both. We
can think of this as akin to the "exclusive or."

The symmetric difference has the following properties:

> _Lemma_. ${A \Delta B = B \Delta A}$

> _Lemma_. ${A \Delta (B \Delta C) = (A \Delta B) \Delta C}$

> _Lemma_. ${A \Delta \varnothing = A}$

> _Lemma_. ${A \Delta A = \varnothing}$

> _Lemma_. ${A \Delta A' = \mathbb{U}}$

## Power Sets

A mathematician requested a VISA to enter the United States with his family
(him, his wife, and his son). The embassy replied, "Please submit passport
photos of your family." Unsure whether multiple persons were supposed to be
in each photo, the mathematician took one for every combination. Each on
their own, him and his wife, him and his son, his wife and his son, etc.
Photos taken, the mathematician returned to the embassy.

The clerk was dumbfounded. After several minutes she said, "There's no one
in this photo."

"Yes. That is a photo of the empty set."

Consider the set ${B = \{ 0, 1 \},}$ the set of binary digits. Using our
definition of subsets, what are all the different possible subsets of
${B?}$ We can lay them out:

- ${\varnothing }$
- ${\{ 0 \}}$
- ${\{ 1 \}}$
- ${\{ 0, 1 \}}$

There are four different possible subsets. Suppose we place all these
possible subsets in an entirely new set:

$$
 \{ \varnothing, \{ 0 \}, \{ 1 \}, \{ 0, 1 \} \}
$$

We call the set above the **power set** of ${B.}$ We denote this power set
as such:

$$
 \mathcal{P}(B) = \{ \varnothing, \{ 0 \}, \{ 1 \}, \{ 0, 1 \} \}
$$

The symbol ${\mathcal{P}}$ is used in these notes, but other symbols are
used throughout mathematics: ${\mathscr{P}, \mathbb{P}, \wp,}$ and a few
others. Defining the power set more formally:

> _Definition_. Given a set ${S,}$ the _power set_ of ${S}$ is the set of
> all subsets of the set ${S.}$ The power set of ${S}$ is denoted
> ${\mathcal{P}(S).}$

One peculiar application of the definition above is with the empty set.
What is the size of the power set of ${\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)?}$ It is 1,
since the only subset of ${\varnothing}$ is ${\{\varnothing\}.}$ Next, what
is the size of the power set of ${ \{ \varnothing \}?}$ It is 2, since
${\mathcal{P}(\{ \varnothing \}) = \{ \varnothing, \{ \varnothing \} \}.}$
If we continue this pattern:

$$
 \begin{aligned}
  &n(\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)) = 1 \\
  &n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\varnothing))) = 2 \\
  &n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)))) = 3 \\
  &n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\varnothing))))) = 4 \\
  &n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)))))) = 5 \\
  &n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\varnothing))))))) = 6 \\
  &n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)))))))) = 7 \\
  &n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\varnothing))))))))) = 8 \\
  &n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)))))))))) = 9 \\
  &n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\varnothing))))))))))) = 10 \\
 \end{aligned}
$$

The pattern above yields to a direct corollary (as well as several other
ideas we will explore in the sections on number theory):

> _Corollary_. If as set ${A}$ has ${n}$ elements, where ${n \in \N,}$ then
> ${\mathcal{P}(A) = 2^n.}$

The proof of this corollary: Let ${A}$ be a set. For every subset of ${A,}$
there are two possibilities for each element ${x \in A:}$ Either (1) ${x}$
is in the subset, or ${x}$ is not in the subset. Therefore, it follows that
for ${n}$ elements, there are ${2^n}$ possibilities in making a subset of
${A.}$ From the definition of the powerset, it follows that the number of
subsets of ${A}$ is ${2^n.}$

## Unions & Intersections Generally

At this point, we have a much better understanding of basic set theory. We
can now introduce the generalized forms of unions and intersections.
Because sets comply with the laws of associativity, the sets
${A \cup B \cup C}$ and ${A \cap B \cap C}$ are unambiguous. In other
words, we don't need parentheses to communicate what we mean.
${A \cup B \cup C}$ is the same set as ${(A \cup B) \cup C}$ which is the
same set as ${A \cup (B \cup C).}$ The same goes for ${A \cap B \cap C.}$

For example, suppose ${A = \{ 1, 2 \},}$ ${B = \{ 1, 4 \},}$ and
${C = \{ 1, 7 \}.}$ Then ${A \cup B \cup C = \{ 1, 2, 4, 7 \},}$ and
${A \cap B \cap C = \{ 1 \}.}$ The set ${A \cup B \cup C}$ is the set
containing all the elements that occur in at least one of ${A,}$ ${B,}$ and
${C.}$ The set ${A \cap B \cap C}$ contains all the elements in all three
of ${A,}$ ${B,}$ and ${C.}$ We can extend this idea to any ${n}$ number of
sets:

> _Definition_. Let ${A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n}$ be sets. The union of these
> sets is denoted:
>
> $$
>   A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \ldots \cup A_n = \bigcup\limits_{i = 1}^{n} A_i
> $$

From the definition above, it follows that the notation
${\bigcup\limits_{i = 1}^{n} A_i}$ represents a set. Accordingly, when we
write ${x \in \bigcup\limits_{i = 1}^{n} A_i,}$ we imply that ${x}$ is a
member of at least one of ${A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n.}$ This idea also applies
to intersections:

> _Definition_. Let ${A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n}$ be sets. The _intersection_
> of these sets is denoted:
>
> $$
>  A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \ldots \cap A_n = \bigcap\limits_{i = 1}^{n} A_i
> $$

## Special Number Sets

Certain number sets are used so frequently in mathematics that we denote
them with symbols.

| Symbol               | Set                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $\mathbb{R}$         | The set of all real numbers. E.g., $\{ -2, 0, 1, \pi, \sqrt{2}, \ldots \}$                                                                                                   |
| $\mathbb{R}^-$       | The set of all negative real numbers. E.g., $\{ - \sqrt{3}, -1, -117, \ldots \}$. This set does not include 0.                                                               |
| ${\R_{\leq 0}}$      | The set of all nonpositive real numbers. This is the set of negative real numbers including 0.                                                                               |
| $\mathbb{R}^+$       | The set of all positive real numbers. E.g., $\{ 2, \pi, e, \frac{1}{2}, \ldots \}$. This set does not include 0.                                                             |
| ${\R_{\geq 0}}$      | The set of all nonnegative positive real numbers. This is the set of all positive real numbers including 0.                                                                  |
| $\mathbb{Q}$         | The set of all rational numbers. These are numbers that can be expressed as $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers. E.g., $\{ 3, 0, -2, 0.75, \ldots \}$.             |
| $\mathbb{I}$         | The set of all irrational numbers. This is the set of all numbers that are not rational numbers. E.g., $\{ - \sqrt{2}, \pi, \phi, e, \ldots \}$.                             |
| $\mathbb{Z}$         | The set of all integers. This is the set of what we refer to as the counting numbers, and their negative counterparts. E.g., $\{ \ldots -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}$.  |
| $\mathbb{Z}^-$       | The set of all negative integers. This is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$. It consists of all the negative integers. E.g., $\{ -1, -2, -3, \ldots \}$. This set does not include 0. |
| $\mathbb{Z}^+$       | The set of all positive integers. Another subset of $\mathbb{Z}$. It consists of all the positive integers. E.g., $\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots \}$. This set does not include 0.   |
| ${\N_{\mathcal{E}}}$ | The set of all even numbers. This is the set of all integers that can be written in the form $2k$, where $k$ is an integer. E.g., $\{ 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 \}$.                 |
| ${\N_{\mathcal{O}}}$ | The set of all odd numbers. This is the set of all integers that can be written in the form $2k + 1$, where $k$ is an integer. E.g., $\{ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, \ldots \}$           |
| $\mathbb{N}$         | The set of all natural numbers. This is the set of all counting numbers (equivalent to the set of positive integers). E.g., $\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots \}$.                      |
| $\mathbb{P}$         | The set of all prime numbers. E.g., $\{ 2, 3, 5, 7, \ldots \}$.                                                                                                              |

## The Number Line

We usually think of numbers as lying along a number line.

<Fig
	link={
		"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1653361169/math/number_line_rbz14e.svg"
	}
	caption={"A number line"}
	width={100}
	imwidth={580}
	imheight={100}
/>

The number 0 is the middle point of the number line, and because of that
property, we refer to it as the **origin**. Every number to the left of 0
is a a negative number. Every number to the right is a positive number. 0
itself is neither positive nor negative.

The real number line is **continuous** because it has no holes (i.e., areas
where there is nothing). There are points all along the number line. Thus,
whenever we refer to a set of numbers (e.g., the integers, the rationals,
the naturals, etc.), we are referring to those points along the number line
corresponding to those numbers.

Some of the numbers are separated from one another at specific, constant
distances. For example, the set of integers consists of numbers separated
by exactly 1 unit of distance. Because the integers are all separated from
one another, we say that the set of integers is **discrete**. This is where
the name of **discrete mathematics** comes from. Discrete mathematics is
the study of _discrete mathematical objects_, while **continuous
mathematics** is the study of _continuous mathematical objects_.

## Ordered Pairs

When set theory was first introduced, it faced a major issue—how do you
represent ordered pairs? The axiom of extension renders order irrelevant
for defining sets. For example, $\{ a, b \}$ is the same set as
$\{ b, a \}$. This is problematic if we are referring specifically to "$a$
then b", rather than "$b$ then $a$."

The patch was to define ordered pairs as sets. An ordered pair is a set of
the form $\{ \{ a \}, \{ a, b \} \}$. The set has two elements: $\{ a \}$
and $\{ a, b \}$. If $a \neq b$, then the two sets are distinct, and $a$ is
in both sets but $b$ is not. With this definition, we can differentiate
between $a$, and $b$. If $a = b$, then we can say that $a$ is both the
first and second element of the pair.

Eventually, however, mathematicians learned that writing
$\{ \{ a \}, \{ a,b \} \mid a = b \}$ was too cumbersome. So, the syntax
was shortened: $(a, b)$.

Formalizing the discussion above: Let $a$ and $b$ be elements. The notation
$(a, b)$ means the **ordered pair** consisting of $a$ and $b$ together,
such that $a$ is the first element of the pair and $b$ is the second
element.

### Equality of Ordered Pairs

Suppose $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ are ordered pairs. The ordered pairs are
equal if, and only if, $a = c$ and $b = d$. Thus, the statement
$(a, b) = (c, d)$ implies that $a = c$ and $b = d$.

## Tuples

While $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0} $, let $x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n$ be elements.
An $n$-tuple consists of $x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n$, ordered as: first $x_1$,
second $x_2$, third $x_3$, and so on, up to $x_n$.

Ordered pairs are more generally called **tuples**, specifically 2-tuples.
The name "tuple" is derived from the English nomenclature for multiple
things: 2 for couple, 3 for triple, 4 for quadruple, etc. In mathematics, a
tuple is a finite list of _ordered_ elements. An **${n-}$tuple** is a
sequence of ${n}$ elements, where $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ (a
non-negative integer). An **ordered 2-tuple** is an*ordered pair*. An
**ordered 3-tuple** is an*ordered triple,* and so on and so forth.

> _Definition: Equality of Tuples_. Let A be the ordered $n$-tuple
> $(x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots x_n)$, and B the ordered $n$-tuple
> $(y_1, y_2, y_3, \ldots y_n)$.

> _Corollary_. A and B are equal if, and only if,
> ${x_1 = y_1, x_2 = y_2, x_3 = y_3, \ldots x_n = y_n}$.

Tuples allow us to conclude that an object has the same properties as
another. For example:

- Jane = ${(female, 27, Wisconsin)}$
- Alice = ${(female, 27, Wisconsin)}$

The elements in the tuples above are said to be equal. We say that tuples
are equal if, and only if, every element in the tuple is the same as the
element with the same position in the other tuple(s).

> _Definition_. Suppose $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. Let $x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n$ be
> elements. The **ordered $n$-tuple** consists of $x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n$,
> with the ordering: first $x_1$, second $x_2$, and so on up to $x_n$.

An **ordered 2-tuple** is an ordered pair, and an **ordered 3-tuple** is an
ordered triple. Two ordered $n$-tuples ($x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n$) and
($y_1, y_2, \ldots y_n$) are equal if, and only if, $x_1 = y_1$,
$x_2 = y_2$, $\ldots$, $x_n = y_n$.

## Cartesian Products

Many objects have multiple properties. For example, a deck of cards can be
described as a set of 52 cards. Each card has a property in common with all
other cards—a face value. That face value itself has two properties—(A) a
suit, and (B) a rank. We can denote these sets as such:

- ${A = \{ ♠, ♥, ♣, ♦ \}}$
- ${B = \{ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A \}}$

Every card in the deck can be represented as an ordered pair of 1 element
from ${A}$ and 1 element from ${B:}$

| _Rank_ | ♠       | ♥       | ♣       | ♦       |
| ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 2      | (♠, 2)  | (♥, 2)  | (♣, 2)  | (♦, 2)  |
| 3      | (♠, 3)  | (♥, 3)  | (♣, 3)  | (♦, 3)  |
| 4      | (♠, 4)  | (♥, 4)  | (♣, 4)  | (♦, 4)  |
| 5      | (♠, 5)  | (♥, 5)  | (♣, 5)  | (♦, 5)  |
| 6      | (♠, 6)  | (♥, 6)  | (♣, 6)  | (♦, 6)  |
| 7      | (♠, 7)  | (♥, 7)  | (♣, 7)  | (♦, 7)  |
| 8      | (♠, 8)  | (♥, 8)  | (♣, 8)  | (♦, 8)  |
| 9      | (♠, 9)  | (♥, 9)  | (♣, 9)  | (♦, 9)  |
| 10     | (♠, 10) | (♥, 10) | (♣, 10) | (♦, 10) |
| J      | (♠, J)  | (♥, J)  | (♣, J)  | (♦, J)  |
| Q      | (♠, Q)  | (♥, Q)  | (♣, Q)  | (♦, Q)  |
| K      | (♠, K)  | (♥, K)  | (♣, K)  | (♦, K)  |
| A      | (♠, A)  | (♥, A)  | (♣, A)  | (♦, A)  |

**Ordered pairs** are a clean and concise way of describing the properties
an object has. In mathematics, all of the pairings above are called a
**Cartesian product**. More formally:

> _Definition_. The _Cartesian product_ of two sets ${A}$ and ${B,}$
> denoted ${A \times B}$, is the set of all ordered pairs ${(a, b)}$, where
> ${a \in A}$ and ${b \in B}$.

Symbolically,
$A_1 \times A_2 \times \ldots \times A_n = \{ (a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_n) \mid a_1 \in A_1, a_2 \in A_2, \ldots , a_n \in A_n \}$
Particularly,
$A_1 \times A_2 = \{ (a_1, a_2) \mid a_1 \in A_1, a_2 \in A_2 \}$ is the
Cartesian product of $A_1$ and $A_2$.

For example: Let ${A = \{ x, y \}}$, ${B = \{ 1, 2, 3 \}}$, and
${C = \{ a, b \}.}$ ${A \times B}$ is:

$$
 A \times B = \{ (x, 1), (y, 1), (x, 2), (y, 2), (x, 3), (y, 3) \}
$$

And ${B \times A:}$

$$
 B \times A = \{ (1,x), (1,y), (2,x), (2,y), (3,x), (3,y) \}
$$

${A \times A}$ is a special case with its own notation. This is the
Cartesian product of a set and the set itself, so we denote it with
${A^2.}$

$$
 A^2 = \{ (x, x), (x, y), (y, x), (y, y) \}
$$

${(A \times B) \times C:}$

$$
 \begin{aligned} (A \times B) \times C = \{ \\ &((x,1), a), \\ &((x,1), b), \\ &((y, 1), a), \\ &((y, 1), b), \\ &((x, 2), a), \\ &((x, 2), b), \\ &((y, 2), a), \\ &((y, 2), b), \\ &((x, 3), a), \\ &((x, 3), b), \\ &((y, 3), a), \\ &((y, 3), b) \\ \} \end{aligned}
$$

Because Cartesian products are more generally sets, they have cardinality:

$$
 \begin{aligned}
  n(A \times B) &= 6 \\
  n(B \times A) &= 6 \\
  n(A \times A) &= 4 \\
  n((A \times B) \times C) &= 12
 \end{aligned}
$$

The Cartesian products ${A \times B,}$ ${B \times A,}$ and
${(A \times B) \times A}$ are more generally called **relations**. We will
revisit relations in more detail later, but for now, know that the
Cartesian product ${A \times B}$ is said to be a _relation_ from the set
${A}$ to the set ${B.}$

Cartesian products are a bridge between discrete mathematics and continuous
mathematics. $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ is the Cartesian product—the
set of all ordered pairs—$(x, y)$ where both $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.
If we assign every $x$ to a point on a line and every $y$ to a point on
another line perpendicular to $x$'s line, the lines form a plane. That
plane is called the **Cartesian plane**, and every ordered pair $(x, y)$
lies on it.

As we can likely gather, Cartesian products are useful for laying out the
possible arrangments of the set of two elements.

## Relations

A **relation** is defined as follows:

> _Definition: Relations_. A _relation_ is any set of ordered pairs.

From the definition above, it follows that any subset of the Cartesian
product ${A \times B}$ is a relation. We have several options for denoting
relations. For example, suppose the order pair ${(x,y)}$ is a member of
some relation. We can write:

$$
 (x,y) \in R \\ x R y
$$

where ${R}$ is some relation. If ${x,y \in \R,}$ it follows that:

$$
 R \subseteq \R \times \R
$$

which we read as "${R}$ is a relation in ${\R.}$" The following are all
examples of relations:

$$
 \begin{aligned} R &= \{ (1,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,4) \} \\[1em] R &= \{ (1,2.3), (2,3.1), (4,2), (3,7.9) \} \\[1em] R &= \{ (x,y) \mid x^2 + y^2 = 9 x,y \in \R \} \\[1em] R &= \{ (x,(y,z)) \mid y^2 + z^2 = x^2,~~~ x,y,z \in \R \} \end{aligned}
$$
