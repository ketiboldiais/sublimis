# Induction

The proofs we've seen so far are examples of one type of proof, the
**direct proof**. We now introduce another type of proof, the **indirect
proof**. Indirect proofs come in several variants. One such variant is the
**proof-by-contradiction**.

## Proof-by-contradiction

In a proof-by-contradiction, we start by assuming that the opposite of what
we are trying to prove (the negation) is true. Then, following this
assumption, we take logical deductions until we arrive at a contradiction
(a proposition that states "false equals true"). If we ever reach a
false-equals-true, then that means that what we assumed from the very
beginning was wrong. In other words, the opposite (the negation) cannot be
true. And since the negation cannot be true, the original proposition must
be true. More formally:

To prove a proposition ${P}$ is true, we assume that ${P}$ is false
(${\neg P}$ is true). From this hypothesis (${P}$ is false), we prove that
a falsehood is true (${P}$ is false implies ${P}$ is true). In doing so, we
prove that it must be the case that ${P}$ is true.

This works because if we can prove that ${\neg P \implies F,}$ then the
only way for ${\neg P \implies F}$ to be true is if ${\neg P}$ is false.
And if ${\neg P}$ is false, then ${P}$ is true.

Example: Prove that ${\sqrt{2}}$ is irrational. First, let's be clear about
what our terms mean. An irrational number is a number that cannot be
written as the ratio of two integers. In contrast, a rational number is a
number that can be written as the ratio of two integers.

When we write a proof by contradiction, we always start by indicating that
the proof is a proof by contradiction.

Assume for the purpose of contradiction that ${\sqrt{2}}$ is a rational
number. If ${\sqrt{2}}$ is rational, then ${\sqrt{2} = \dfrac{a}{b}}$ where
${a}$ and ${b}$ are integers, and ${\dfrac{a}{b}}$ is a fraction expressed
in lowest terms (a fraction with no common divisors).

Squaring both sides: ${2 = \dfrac{a^2}{b^2}.}$ Multiplying both sides by
${b^2,}$ we obtain ${2b^2 = a^2.}$ This implies that ${a^2}$ is even, since
${2b^2}$ can be written as ${2k}$ given that ${b}$ is an integer. Because
${a^2}$ is even, then it must be true that ${a}$ is even (since the square
of an even number is even) &mdash; ${(2 \space\vert\space a)}$ ("two
divides ${a}$").

Given that ${a}$ is even, ${a^2}$ is a multiple of 4 &mdash;
${(4 \space\vert\space a^2).}$ This means that
${(4 \space\vert\space 2b^2).}$ Dividing each side by 2,
${(2 \space\vert\space b^2).}$

Now, if 2 divides by ${b^2,}$ then it must be the case that ${b}$ is even.
We've arrived at a contradiction. If ${a}$ is even and ${b}$ is even, then
${\dfrac{a}{b}}$ is not a fraction in lowest terms. This means that
${\sqrt{2}}$ cannot be rational, so it must be irrational. ${\blacksquare}$

The proof above was first discovered by a religious society of ancient
Greece called the Pythagoreans. In ancient Greece, the practice of
mathematics was a religious exercise. The ancient Greeks believed that
mathematics was ruled by two gods &mdash; Apeiron and Peras. Apeiron was
viewed as a malevolent god: the embodiment of primal chaos, the god of the
infinite. In contrast, Peras was viewed as the benevolent one: the
embodiment of order, the god of the finite.

One of the axioms of these mathematical mystics was that there were no
irrational numbers &mdash; they simply did not exist. The Greeks denied
their existence because they were evil; they were infinite. In contrast,
the mystics affirmed the existence of the rational numbers because they
were finite.

This denial of the infinite extended to other spheres. Every line,
according to the Pythagoreans, was finite. From this axiom, they derived
what we now know as the Pythagorean Theorem. If there was a triangle with
legs of length 1, then the length of the hypotenuse was ${\sqrt{2}.}$
Because they denied the existence of the irrationals, the Pythagoreans
constructed a theorem that ${\sqrt{2}}$ was rational. Eventually, the
Pythagoreans discovered the proof above.

Needless to say, this caused mayhem. The Pythagoreans were now confronted
with the fact that their axioms were inconsistent. Every theorem they had
proven was premised on the non-existence of irrationals, and they now had
just found an irrational. The solution: Cover it up. According to legend,
the Pythagoreans not only denied the result, they went so far as to murder
the member who discovered the proof.

## The Well-Ordering Principle

The **Well-ordering Principle** states:

> _Definition_. Every nonempty set of nonnegative integers has a smallest
> element.

This short statement contains numerous implications. First, it's false for
the empty set ${\emptyset,}$ since the empty set contains no elements.
Second, it's false for the negative integers. And since it's false for the
negative integers, it's false for the set of all integers. I.e., ${\Z}$ is
not well ordered. And since it's false for ${\Z,}$ it's false for the set
of all rational numbers, ${\mathbb{Q}.}$ And since it's false for
${\mathbb{Q},}$ it's false for the set of all real numbers, ${\R.}$ These
all imply that there's something very special about the nonnegative
integers, a.k.a. the natural numbers ${\N.}$[^wop]

[^wop]:
    The well-ordering principle is often shortened to WOP, not to be
    confused with Belcalis Marlenis AlmÃ¡nzar and Megan Jovon Ruth Pete's
    popular hit, _WAP_.

The well-ordering principle allows us to construct numerous
proofs-by-contradiction, and it is a cornerstone of proof-by-induction. For
example, recall the proof that ${\sqrt{2}}$ is irrational. In the previous
proof, we used a little number theory and algebraic manipulation to
construct a proof-by-contradiction. In that proof, however, we relied on a
particular postulate:

> _Postulate_. Let ${m, n \in \Z^{+}.}$ Then ${\dfrac{m}{n}}$ can be
> written in _lowest terms_. In other words, ${\dfrac{m}{n}}$ cannot be
> written as ${\dfrac{m'}{n'},}$ where ${m'}$ and ${n'}$ are positive
> integers with no common prime factors.

How do we know that this postulate is true? Well, we can prove it with WOP:

**Proof (By Contradiction)**. Let ${m, n \in \Z^{+}.}$ Suppose
${\dfrac{m}{n}}$ _cannot_ be written in lowest terms. Further suppose that
${A}$ is the set of all positive integers that are numerators of
${\dfrac{m}{n}.}$ In other words, ${m \in A.}$ Because ${m \in A,}$ ${A}$
is nonempty.

Since ${A}$ is nonempty and ${A \subseteq \N,}$ then by the well-ordering
principle, ${A}$ contains a smallest integer ${m_0 \in A.}$ Hence, again by
WOP there exists an integer ${n_0 > 0}$ such that:

$$
	\dfrac{m_0}{n_0}
$$

cannot be written in lowest terms.

Because ${\dfrac{m_0}{n_0}}$ cannot be written in lowest terms, ${m_0}$ and
${n_0}$ must have a common prime factor, ${p > 1.}$ Thus:

$$
	\dfrac{m_0}{n_0} = \dfrac{m_0/p}{n_0/p}
$$

This implies that ${\dfrac{m_0/p}{n_0/p}}$ cannot be written in lowest
terms either. Because ${A}$ is the set of all positive integers that are
numerators of ${\dfrac{m}{n},}$ the numerator ${\dfrac{m_0}{p}}$ is a
member of ${A.}$ But ${m_0 / p < m_0.}$ This contradicts the fact that
${m_0}$ is the smallest element of ${A.}$

Since the assumption that ${C}$ leads to a contradiction, it follows that
${C}$ must be empty. And because ${C}$ must be empty, for all positive
integers, the fraction ${\dfrac{m}{n}}$ that _can_ be written in lowest
terms. ${\blacksquare}$

## Proof-by-induction

We now turn to another variety of proofs &mdash; **proof-by-induction**.
The concept of induction is actually a predicate itself:

> _Axiom_. Let ${P(n)}$ be a predicate. If ${P(0)}$ is true, and
> ${\forall n \in \N : (P(n) \implies P(n + 1))}$ is true, then
> ${\forall n \in \N : P(n)}$ is true.

Another way of expressing the axiom above: If ${P(0)}$ is true, and if
${P(0) \implies P(1),}$ and if ${P(1) \implies P(2),}$ all the way up to
${P(n),}$ then ${P(n)}$ is true for any natural number ${n.}$ As an axiom,
induction is relatively straightforward. If know that ${P(0)}$ is true, and
we know that ${P(0) \implies P(1),}$ and ${P(1) \implies P(2),}$ all the
way up to ${P(n),}$ then it makes sense for ${P(n)}$ to be true for all
${n.}$ We can think of this as akin to dominoes falling.

Of note, mathematical induction is _not_ a form of _inductive reasoning_.
In inductive reasoning, we reason that because of some previously observed
phenomenon, we can make inferences about the future. This is entirely
unrelated to mathematical induction. Mathematical induction is, in fact, a
form of deductive reasoning, not inductive reasoning. In other words,
mathematical induction is to induction what Rocky Mountain oysters are to
oysters. Similar names but very, very different things. When mathematicians
use the word "induction" alone, they are referring to the mathematical,
rather than epistemic, context.

Let's see an example. Prove the following:

> ${\forall n \in \N,}$
>
> $$
> 	  1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + n = \dfrac{n(n + 1)}{2}
> $$

Note that the ellipses, ${\ldots,}$ tells us that we must complete the
pattern. In this case, there is a pattern to ${1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + n.}$ In
this case, each element in the sequence is an increment-by-one of the
element before it. Because this can be very vague, we have several ways to
express this idea more explicitly.

$$
	\sum_{i = 1}^{n} i = \sum_{}^{1 \leq i \leq n} i = \sum_{1 \leq i \leq n}^{} i
$$

In each of the notations above, we are expressing the clause, "The sum of
${i}$ from ${i = 1}$ to ${i = n.}$ Thus, the proposition we are asked to
prove can be more succinctly expressed as:

$$
	\forall n \in \N : \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} = \dfrac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right)
$$

The notation above is called a **summation**. There are a number of reasons
why use the summation notation. To begin with, if ${n = 1,}$ then the
expression ${1 + 2 + \ldots + n}$ is ambiguous and confusing. With the
summation notation, we can simply say the when ${n = 1,}$ then
${\sum_{i = 1}^{n} = 1,}$ since the sum of 1 to 1 is simply 1. Similarly,
if ${n \leq 0,}$ then ${\sum_{i = 1}^{n} = 0.}$ Why? Because there are no
numbers to sum. We call these two cases, ${n = 0}$ and ${n = 1,}$ the
**edge cases**.

All this in mind, let us write the proof. The first thing we do is to state
that the proof will be done by induction. Next step: What is our predicate?
In other words, what is the hypothesis? Here, it is the proposition we are
trying to prove: That ${\sum_{i = 1}^{n} = \dfrac{n(n + 1)}{2}.}$

Proof (by induction).

Let ${P(n)}$ be the proposition that
${\sum_{i = 1}^{n} = \dfrac{n(n + 1)}{2}.}$

Now we begin thinking about the proof. The first thing to analyze is the
**base case**. Here, we must establish that ${P(0)}$ is true. We saw this
earlier. The sum of ${i = 1}$ to 0 of ${i}$ is 0. The proposition is also
true by algebra:

$$
	\sum_{i = 1}^{0} = \dfrac{0(0 + 1)}{2} = 0
$$

Having proved the base case is true, we now must prove the second part, the
**inductive case**. In this case, we must show: For ${n \geq 0,}$
${P(n) \implies P(n + 1)}$ is true.

Now, recall basic logic. How do we show that an implication is true? There
is only one situation where the implication is false, and that is when
${P(n)}$ is true and ${P(n + 1)}$ is false. Thus, to prove this
implication, we must assume that ${P(n)}$ is true, then determine whether
${P(n + 1)}$ is true. So, putting together what we have so far:

Let ${P(n)}$ be the proposition that
${\sum_{i = 1}^{n} = \dfrac{n(n + 1)}{2}.}$ When ${n = 0,}$ then
${\sum_{i = 1}^{0} = 0.}$ This is the base case. We now prove the inductive
case: For ${n \geq 0,}$ ${P(n) \implies P(n + 1).}$

Assume ${P(n)}$ is true for purposes of induction. Following this
assumption, we must prove that
${\sum_{i = 1}^{n + 1} = \dfrac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2}.}$

The last sentence above is arguably the most confusing for
non-mathematician readers. It seems as if in trying to prove ${P(n),}$ we
are assuming ${P(n).}$ Isn't this circular? Admittedly, it appears to
teeter very close. In actuality, it is not at all circular. We are assuming
${P(n)}$ to prove the necessary condition of the proposition
${P(n) \implies P(n + 1).}$ Remember, in mathematics, we write a proof one
step at a time, from one deduction to the next.

We should also be very clear about what we mean when we say something like
"Assume ${x.}$" We are not saying that ${x}$ is, in fact, true. We are
saying, "Just pretend for a moment&mdash;for the sake of a
hypothetical&mdash;that ${x}$ is true." The only purpose of an "Assume
${x}$" statement is to obtain a non-hypothetical statement of the form
${x \implies y.}$ For example, remember how we wrote a
proof-by-contradiction? The same idea is at work here. We want to reach
some non-hypothetical conclusion: "When we assume ${x,}$ this is what
happens. And since this is what happens, it must be true that ..."

Returning to the proof, we are now trying to prove that
${1 + 2 + \ldots + (n + 1) = \dfrac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2}.}$ We can rewrite
this as ${1 + 2 + \ldots + n + (n + 1) = \dfrac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2}.}$ Since
we assumed that ${P(n)}$ is true, we know that:

$$
	\overbrace{1 + 2 + \ldots + n}^{\dfrac{n(n + 1)}{2}} + (n + 1)
$$

Thus, we have:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		\dfrac{n(n + 1)}{2} + (n + 1) &= \dfrac{n^2 + n + 2n + 2}{2} \\
		&= \dfrac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2} \\
		&= \dfrac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2}
	\end{aligned}
$$

Putting this all together:

Let ${P(n)}$ be the proposition that
${\sum_{i = 1}^{n} = \dfrac{n(n + 1)}{2}.}$ When ${n = 0,}$ then
${\sum_{i = 1}^{0} = 0.}$ This is the base case. We now prove the inductive
case: For ${n \geq 0,}$ ${P(n) \implies P(n + 1).}$

Assume ${P(n)}$ is true for purposes of induction. Following this
assumption, we must prove that
${\sum_{i = 1}^{n + 1} = \dfrac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2}.}$ Since ${P(n)}$ is
true, we can rewrite the expression ${1 + 2 + \ldots + n + (n + 1)}$ as
${\dfrac{n(n + 1)}{2} + (n + 1).}$ Rewriting this expression, we have
${\dfrac{n^2 + n + 2n + 2}{2},}$ which is ${\dfrac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2}.}$
Factoring this expression, we have ${\dfrac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2}.}$

Thus, we have proved that ${P(n + 1)}$ is true. And since ${P(n + 1)}$ is
true when ${P(n)}$ is true, the implication ${P(n) \implies P(n + 1)}$
cannot be false. Therefore, the implication ${P(n) \implies P(n + 1)}$ must
be true. Ergo,
${\forall n \in \N : \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} = \dfrac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right)}$
is true. ${\blacksquare}$

Let's do another example. Prove the following:

$$
	\forall n \in \N: (3 \space\vert\space n^3 - n)
$$

Let's first test the predicate:

$$
	n = 5 : n^3 - n = (5)^3 - 5 = 125 - 5 = 120
$$

3 does in fact divide 120.

First, what is our induction hypothesis? It is: Let
${P(n) = 3 \space\vert\space n^3 - n}$ Next, we should establish that our
base case is. Our base case is when ${n = 0.}$ Checking:

$$
	P(0) = (0)^3 - 0 = 0
$$

Our base case is true; 3 does in fact divide 0. Now we turn to the
inductive step: For ${n \geq 0,}$ ${P(n) \implies P(n + 1)}$ is true. More
formally:

$$
	(\forall n \in \N \mid n \geq 0) : P(n) \implies P(n + 1)
$$

To prove that this is true, we first assume that ${P(n)}$ is true. In other
words, we assume that ${3 \space\vert\space n^3 - n}$ is true. Now we
examine the necessary condition, ${P(n + 1).}$ The proposition ${P(n + 1)}$
is ${(n + 1)^3 - (n + 1).}$ Exampding this:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		(n + 1)^3 - (n + 1) &= n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1 - n + 1
		&= n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n
	\end{aligned}
$$

Looking at this result, it doesn't really look like ${n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n}$ is
a multiple of 3. We need to wrtie this a bit more. We want to use the fact
that ${n^3 - n}$ is a multiple of three (remember, we assumed it).
Remember, whenever we perform a proof-by-induction, we always want to make
use of the sufficient condition. So, to make use of our sufficient
condition, we want to get a ${-n}$ inside the expression. So, we need to
rewrite the expression so as to incorporate a minus sign:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
	(n + 1)^3 - (n + 1) &= n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1 - n + 1 \\
		&= n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n \\
		&= n^3 - n + 3n^2 + 3n \\
		&= (n^3 - n) + 3(n^2 + n)
	\end{aligned}
$$

Now it's very clear that ${P(n + 1)}$ is true:

$$
	\overbrace{(n^3 - n)}^{\text{multiple of 3}} + \overbrace{3(n^2 + n)}^{\text{multiple of 3}}
$$

We need not always have a base case start at 0. We could have a base case
${P(b)}$ and then the induction step
${\forall n \geq b : P(n) \implies P(n + 1).}$

Consider the following problem. We have a ${2^n \times 2^n}$ grid, and we
want to tile it with an L-shaped tile, ${2 \times 2,}$ such that the
entirety of the grid is filled with one square open:

<Fig
	link={"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1653186973/math/tiling_problem.svg"}
	caption={"Tiling problem"}
/>



It looks like we can from the diagram above. Now we want to prove it for
all ${n.}$ Here is the proposition:

> ${\forall n \in \N,}$ there exists a way to tile a ${2^n \times 2^n}$
> region with a center square missing.

First, we establish our induction hypothesis: ${P(n) \coloneqq}$
${\exists}$ a way to tile a ${2^n \times 2^n}$ region with a center square
missing. Second, we establish the base case, ${P(0.)}$ Where ${P(0),}$ we
only have one square, since ${2^0 \times 2^0 = 1.}$ That is the center
square missing, so ${P(n)}$ is true where ${n = 0;}$ ${P(0)}$ is true.

Now we consider the inductive case: For ${n \geq 0,}$ assume ${P(n)}$ is
true to verify ${P(n) \implies P(n + 1).}$ Now we must prove that
${P(n + 1)}$ is true.

Let's consider ${2^{n + 1} \times 2^{n + 1}.}$ It turns out it's very
difficult to prove when a center square is missing (try it). It is actually
much easier if we make a stronger assumption &mdash; any square is missing.
With this assumption, we can place the missing square anywhere. In doing
so, we can think of any ${2^{n+1} \times 2^{n+1}}$ region as smaller parts
of ${2^n \times 2^n.}$ And since ${P(n)}$ is true, we can place the missing
square anywhere in a region ${2^{n+1} \times 2^{n+1}.}$
