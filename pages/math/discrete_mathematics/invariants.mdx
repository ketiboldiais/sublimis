# Invariants

Great proofs have several characteristics: (1) correct; (2) comlete; (3)
clear; (4) brief—crisp and concise, not an overload of details; (5)
well-organized—modular, in that its pieces or discretely separated, i.e.,
using lemmas; (6) well-ordered—flowing from one premise to the next; (7)
elegant—very clever. Great proofs are very much like well-written source
code.

Consider a puzzle. We want to move the tiles below such that they are in
alphabetical order. We can only move up, down, left, or right, and we
cannot take the tiles of the grid:

Here is the proposition:

> There is no sequence of legal moves to invert ${g}$ and ${h}$ and return
> all other letters to their original position.

To prove this proposition, we must use an **invariant**. To show that a
system can never reach a particular special state, we can do so by showing
that there is some property called the invariant that holds at the initial
state, is preserved at every legal move, and does not exist at the special
state. In other words, if we have a property that exists at the initial
state, and holds at every successive state, then the only state we can ever
reach is a state that has that property, the invariant. Thus, if the
special state has that property, we can never reach it.

To figure out the invariant, we have to think about what happens at each
move in the system. Let's first consider the row-move. We can move a tile
to the left or right, and everything else stays the same. In other words,
the relative order, or the **natural order** of the tiles, is left
unchanged. For example, if we moved ${g}$ in the diagram above, the
relative order remains the same: ${a-b-c,}$ ${d-e-f,}$ and ${h-g.}$ We
should state this as a lemma:

> A row move does not change the order of the letters.

And we should prove this lemma:

> **Proof**. In a row move, we move an item from some cell ${i}$ to an
> adjacent cell ${i+1}$ or ${i-1.}$ Because nothing else moves, the order
> of the items is preserved.

Second, let's consider the column-move. We can move a tile up or down. This
changes the natural order. For example, if we moved ${f}$ in the diagram
above, the relative order has changed—${f}$ used to be after ${d}$ and
${e,}$ but now it is after ${h}$ and ${g.}$

From these two possible column moves, we can determine that a column move
changes either (a) the previous two tiles, or (b) the next two tiles. This
means the relative orders of two pairs changes. Let's state this as a
lemma:

> A column move changes the relative order of precisely two pairs of items.

We should prove this:

> **Proof**. In a column move, we move an item in cell ${i}$ to a blank
> spot in cell ${i - 3}$ or ${i + 3.}$ And when an item moves three
> positions, it changes relative order with two other items, either cell
> ${i - 1,}$ ${i - 2,}$ ${i + 1,}$ or ${i + 2.}$

With these two lemmas, we've exhausted the moves. What can we infer from
these lemmas? In a row move, nothing changes. In a column move, two pairs
change. So what is the invariant? What is something that will not change?
Suppose we have an even number of tiles out order to begin with. Now we
know our only option is to use column moves, since row moves do not change
any relative order. But with column moves, we can only change two tiles at
most. And if we can only change two tiles at most, then we can we will
always have an even number of tiles out of order. More formally:

> _Definition_. A pair of letters, ${L_1}$ and ${L_2,}$ form an
> _inversion_, or an _inverted pair_, if ${L_1}$ precedes ${L_2}$ in the
> alphabet and ${L_1}$ appears after ${L_2}$ in the grid.

The above definition defines an **inverted pair**. For example, consider
the following configuration:

Here, there are three inversions; ${(d, f), (e, f), (e, g).}$ Like the case
where we have an even number of out-of-order tiles, if we have an odd
number, no matter how many column moves we perform, there will always be an
odd number of out-or-order tiles. Knowing this, if we start with one tile
out-of-order, then we will always have an odd number of tiles out of order,
because 1 is an odd number. We can state another lemma:

> During a move, the number of inversions can only increase by 2, decrease
> by 2 or stay the same.

The proof for this lemma is a simple case-exhaustion.

> **Proof (by exhaustion)**. In a row move, there are no changes in the
> number of inversions, following the first lemma. In a column move, two
> pairs change order, by the second lemma. There are three cases of how the
> pairs were arranged before the column move: (a) Both pairs were in order.
> (b) Both pairs were inverted. (c) One pair was inverted, the other was
> not.

In case (a), the number of inverted pairs goes up by 2. In case (b), the
number of inverted pairs goes down by 2. In case (c), the number of
inverted pairs stays the same.

Following the second lemma, we have a corollary:

> During a move, the parity of the number of inverted pairs stays the same.

The proof for this corollary is founded from an axiom in number theory:
Adding 2 or subtracting 2 from an even or odd number does not change its
parity. The corollary we just drew is what cracks this problem. In the
original problem, we start with 1 tile out-of-order. Thus, at the beginning
of the problem, the parity of the number of inversions is 1. Following
corollary 2, the parity of the number of inversions will always be odd:

> In every state reachable from the start state, the parity of the number
> inversions is odd.

The proof of this lemma is by induction. In fact, invariant proofs are
always by induction. The inductive hypothesis here is ${P(n):}$ "After any
sequence of ${n}$ moves from the start state, the parity of the number of
inversions is odd."

> **Proof**. In the base case ${P(0),}$ there is exactly one inversion.
> Thus, the base case is true. Now we consider the inductive case. Here, we
> want to show that for any ${n \geq 0,}$ ${P(n) \implies P(n + 1).}$
> Consider any sequence of ${n+1}$ moves: ${m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_{n+1}.}$
>
> Because of ${P(n),}$ we know that after ${n}$ moves, the parity is still
> odd. By the first corollary, during any move, the parity of the number of
> inversions does not change during ${m_{n+1}.}$ Therefore, the parity of
> the number of inversions after all ${n+1}$ moves is odd. Hence,
> ${P(n+1)}$ is true. Ergo, ${P(n) \implies P(n+1)}$ is true.

Now we can prove the theorem:

> **Proof**. The parity of the number inversions in the desired state is
> ${0}$—even. By the fourth lemma, the desired state cannot be reached
> using legal moves from the start state, because the start state's parity
> is odd.
