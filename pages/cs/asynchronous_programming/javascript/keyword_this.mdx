# The Keyword "this"

Right off the bat, here are the key rules behind the `this` keyword in
JavaScript:

1. `this` is an expression that serves as a reference to some environment.
2. The value of `this` is determined at runtime.
3. The default value of `this` is the global object.
4. When an object method is called, the `this` keyword refers to the object
   the method was called on.
5. In strict mode, if a function's body uses the `this` keyword, the `this`
   is undefined until the function is called.
6. In an arrow function, the value of `this` is the value of `this` in the
   arrow function's enclosing context.
7. In a constructor call, `this` refers to the object being constructed.
8. In an event handler, `this` refers to the element the event listener is
   attached to.

A variable declared with `var` in the global scope will be included in the
`window` object as a property. But, variables declared with `let` and
`const` will not be included. The `this` keyword is a keyword that
references the current _execution scope_, and gives an _object_ back as its
output. Thus, the returned object changes depending on the current
execution's scope. The execution might have a global scope, or it might
have some other scope—expression scope, block scope, function scope, etc.
For example, consider the code below:

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
	console.log("Hi");
	console.log(this);
}
helloWorld();
```

```bash
Window {
	window: Window,
	self: Window,
	document: document,
	name: "",
	location: Location,
	…
}
```

In the code above, our function contains the statement,
`console.log(this);`. This statement says, "JavaScript, display in the
console this function's scope." In doing so, we get back an object called
the `Window`. The window is the global scope in the browser. When we wrote
the function `helloworld`, we wrote directly into the program, not under
any other block. When we write functions like this, the functions are
written in the _global scope_. When a function is written in the _global
scope_, it becomes a property in the global scope object (in this case, the
browser's global scope), and as such, we can call it with the usual object
syntax: `window.functionName()`. The same goes for variables declared with
`var` directly into the program (not inside any other block scope).

```javascript
var vector = 3;
```

By declaring the variable `vector` with the keyword `var` above, the name
`vector` now becomes a property of the `Window` object, which we can call
with `window.vector`. But, this rule does not apply to variables declared
with the keywords `let` and `const`.

# Why is 'this' so useful?

Consider the code below, where we write a function using the `this` keyword
inside an object:

```javascript
// An object containing the properties of tree ferns
const treeFern = {
	scientificName: "Dicksonia antarctica",
	genus: "Dicksonia",
	family: "Dicksoniaceae",
	Order: "Cyatheales",
	Class: "Polypodiopsida",
	Division: "Polypodiophyta",
	Kingdom: "Plantae",
	allDetails() {
		console.log(this);
	},
};
treeFern.allDetails();
```

```bash
{
	scientificName: 'Dicksonia antarctica',
	genus: 'Dicksonia',
	family: 'Dicksoniaceae',
	Order: 'Cyatheales',
	Class: 'Polypodiopsida',
	Division: 'Polypodiophyta',
	Kingdom: 'Plantae',
	allDetails: [Function: allDetails]
}
```

In the example above, we wrote the function `allDetails()` inside the
object `treeFern`. That function contains the statement
`console.log(this);`, which tells JavaScript, "Display in the console this
function's scope." When we call the function with object syntax,
`treeFern.allDetails()`, we get back that the entire scope of that
function, the object `treefern`.

An astute observer might notice the immediate utility of the `this`
keyword: It allows us to use the properties inside an object while writing
statements inside said object.

```javascript
// Here is an object of some mathematical functions:
const mathematician = {
	firstName: "Renee",
	lastName: "Descartes",
	firstNameDisplay() {
		console.log(this.firstName);
	},
};
mathematician.firstNameDisplay();
```

```bash
Renee
```

A more elaborate example:

```javascript
const RD = {
	firstName: "Renee",
	lastName: "Descartes",
	notable: "Cartesian plane",
	details() {
		console.log(
			`${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}, notable for the ${this.notable}.`,
		);
	},
};
RD.details();
```

```bash
Renee Descartes, notable for the Cartesian plane.
```

# Using Destructuring Syntax with 'this'

In the example above, we constantly had to write the `this` keyword. We can
cut all of that out with the _destructuring syntax_:

```javascript
const rD = {
	firstName: "Renee",
	lastName: "Descartes",
	notable: "Cartesian plane",
	details() {
		const { firstName, lastName, notable } = this;
		console.log(`${firstName} ${lastName}, notable for the ${notable}.`);
	},
};
rD.details(); // Output: Renee Descartes, notable for the Cartesian plane.
```

The `this` keyword allows us to write methods that can "see" the other
properties inside the object.

## Using the 'this' Keyword to Reference Methods

We can use `this` to reference other methods inside an object:

````javascript
const sR = {
	first: "Srinivasa",
	last: "Ramanujan",
	country: "India",
	fullName() {
		return `${this.first} ${this.last}`
	},
	summary() {
		const fullName = this.fullName();
		return `${fullName} is a mathematician from ${this.country}.`
	}
};
console.log(sR.summary());
```bash
Srinivasa Ramanujan is a mathematician from India
````

## The Value of 'This'

The value of the `this` keyword depends on how we invoke the function that
uses it. Put simply, the value of the `this` keyword depends on <i>where we
write it</i> and _how we write it_. To see this crucial point, consider the
code below:

```javascript
// Same object from the preceding example.
const sR = {
	first: "Srinivasa",
	last: "Ramanujan",
	country: "India",
	fullName() {
		return `${this.first} ${this.last}`;
	},
	summary() {
		const fullName = this.fullName();
		return `${fullName} is mathematician from ${this.country}.`;
	},
};
```

Suppose we assign the method `SR.summary()` to a variable:

```javascript
const summary = sR.summary;
```

Now suppose we call that function:

```javascript
console.log(summary());
```

```bash
TypeError: this.fullName is not a function
```

Compare the error above with the following code:

```javascript
// Same object from the preceding example.
const sR = {
	first: "Srinivasa",
	last: "Ramanujan",
	country: "India",
	fullName() {
		return `${this.first} ${this.last}`;
	},
	summary() {
		console.log(this); // Let's see what the object is
		const fullName = this.fullName();
		return `${fullName} is mathematician from ${this.country}.`;
	},
};
const summary = sR.summary;
console.log(summary());
```

```bash
Window {window: Window, self: Window, document: document, name: "", location: Location, …}
Uncaught TypeError: this.fullName is not a function at summary
```

In the second example, we see that `this` is referencing the object
`window`, the browser's global scope. If we instead just used the typical
object key syntax rather than the variable:

```javascript
// Same object from the preceding example.
const sR = {
	first: "Srinivasa",
	last: "Ramanujan",
	country: "India",
	fullName() {
		return `${this.first} ${this.last}`;
	},
	summary() {
		console.log(this);
		const fullName = this.fullName();
		return `${fullName} is mathematician from ${this.country}.`;
	},
};
console.log(sR.summary());
```

```bash
Output:
{first: "Srinivasa", last: "Ramanujan", country: "India", fullName: ƒ, summary: ƒ}
Srinivasa Ramanujan is mathematician from India.
```

Now we see that the value of `this` is the object it's contained in, `sR`,
rather than the `window` object, the global scope.This shows that the value
of `this` is determined by the way we invoke the function that uses the
`this` keyword. One way to think about this: When we explicitly call the
function with the object syntax, `object.function`, the value of `this` is
the object itself. But, when we simply just call the function without
explicitly stating the object, the value of `this` is the global scope
object (which, in the browser, is the `window` object).
