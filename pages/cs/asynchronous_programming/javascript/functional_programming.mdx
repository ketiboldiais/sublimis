# Functional Programming Techniques

As a language, JavaScript is conducive to functional programming. The notes
below cover some of the more common functional programming techniques in
JavaScript.

## Hooking

⚠️ _This section assumes familiary with the React library._

Hooking is a functional programming pattern for handling side-effects. In a
broad sense, hooks are simply wrappers for generic callback functions. To
understand why hooks exist, consider the following React component:

```jsx
export const Greet = ({ greeting }) => {
	return <div>{greeting}</div>;
};
```

to use this component, we simply write:

```jsx
<Greet greeting="Hello" />
```

This is React's approach to creating web applications. The entire
application is some _state_, and to change how the application looks or
behaves, we modify its state. Hooks are patterns for performing these
modifications.

### UseState

Suppose we had the following component:

```jsx
export const Counter = () => {
	let counter = 0;
	return <div>{counter}</div>;
};
```

adding the counter to the application, we get:

export const Counter = () => {
	let counter = 0;
	return <div>{counter}</div>;
};

<Demo>
	<Counter />
</Demo>

Now we want a button with the following action: If we click the button, the
value increments. So, we modify our component by including a button. We
then assign an incrementing function to the button's `onClick` attribute:

```jsx
export const Counter = () => {
	let counter = 0;
	const increment = () => {
		counter = counter + 1;
	};
	return (
		<div>
			{counter}
			<button onClick={increment}>++</button>
		</div>
	);
};
```

The code now results in:

export const Counter2 = () => {
	let counter = 0;
	const increment = () => {
		counter = counter + 1;
	};
	return (
		<div>
			{counter}
			<button onClick={increment}>++</button>
		</div>
	);
};

<Demo>
	<Counter2 />
</Demo>

If we click on the button above, nothing happens. The `counter` variable,
however, is in fact changing. So why aren't we seeing the value change?
Because React doesn't know that the application's state has changed. The
`counter` variable changed, but that variable is not actually _hooked_ onto
the application's state. And because it isn't hooked on to the
application's state, React isn't prompted to re-render the component.

To hook the `counter` variable on to the state, we can use the `useState()`
hook.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

export const Counter = () => {
	const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0); // the initial value

	const increment = () => {
		setCounter(counter + 1);
	};

	return (
		<div>
			{counter}
			<button onClick={increment}>++</button>
		</div>
	);
};
```

now we have a working button:

export const Counter3 = () => {
	const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
	const increment = () => {
		setCounter(counter + 1);
	};
	return (
		<div>
			{counter}
			<button onClick={increment}>++</button>
		</div>
	);
};

<Demo>
	<Counter3 />
</Demo>

The `useState()` hook consists of a few parts to get all of this working.
Let's take a closer look at the syntax:

<Plot
	geo={[
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "\\texttt{const [v,f] = useState(i)}",
			xy: [-4, 6],
		},
		{ type: "label", id: "\\text{variable to mutate}", xy: [-4, -0.3] },
		{ type: "label", id: "\\text{function to mutate v}", xy: [-4, 8.8] },
		{ type: "label", id: "\\text{initial value of v}", xy: [1, 1.8] },
		{ type: "line", start: [-1.9, 0], end: [-1.9, 5.3] },
		{ type: "line", start: [-1.3, 6], end: [-1.3, 8] },
		{ type: "line", start: [2.6, 2], end: [2.6, 5.4] },
	]}
	containerHeight={"55%"}
	marginTop={0}
	noAxes={true}
	id={"useStateSyntax"}
/>

The `useState()` hook can be thought of as encapsulating the following
declaration:

> Where `v` is some value with the initial value `i`, `f` is a function
> that updates the value of `v` at the time `f` is called.

### UseReducer

Suppose we had the following component:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

export const Parity = () => {
	const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
	const [parity, changeParity] = useState(true);
	const clickHandler = () => {
		setCounter(counter + 1);
		changeParity(!parity);
	};
	return (
		<>
			<div>{counter}</div>
			<button onClick={clickHandler}>++</button>
			<div>{parity ? "even" : "odd"}</div>
		</>
	);
};
```

The component above results in:

export const Parity = () => {
	const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
	const [parity, changeParity] = useState(true);
	const clickHandler = () => {
		setCounter(counter + 1);
		changeParity(!parity);
	};
	return (
		<>
			<div>{counter}</div>
			<button onClick={clickHandler}>++</button>
			<div>{parity ? "even" : "odd"}</div>
		</>
	);
};

<Demo>
	<Parity />
</Demo>

In the component above, we have a click-handler that modifies two states —
one that increments the value, and the other that changes the text from
even to odd. For this sample component, the code above is fine. However, we
can imagine a component with numerous states. And the more states we have,
the more unwieldy our click-handler can get.

This is where the `useReduce()` hook comes in handy:

```jsx
import { useReducer } from "react";

export const Parity = () => {
	const reducer = (state, action) => {
		switch (action.type) {
			case "increment":
				return { counter: state.counter + 1, parity: state.parity };
			case "changeParity":
				return { counter: state.counter, parity: !state.parity };
			default:
				return state;
		}
	};
	const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, {
		counter: 0,
		parity: true,
	});
	const clickHandler = () => {
		dispatch({ type: "increment" });
		dispatch({ type: "changeParity" });
	};
	return (
		<>
			<div>{state.counter}</div>
			<button onClick={clickHandler}>++</button>
			<div>{state.parity ? "even" : "odd"}</div>
		</>
	);
};
```

The code abve renders the same component:

export const Parity2 = () => {
	const reducer = (state, action) => {
		switch (action.type) {
			case "increment":
				return { counter: state.counter + 1, parity: state.parity };
			case "changeParity":
				return { counter: state.counter, parity: !state.parity };
			default:
				return state;
		}
	};
	const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, {
		counter: 0,
		parity: true,
	});
	const clickHandler = () => {
		dispatch({ type: "increment" });
		dispatch({ type: "changeParity" });
	};
	return (
		<>
			<div>{state.counter}</div>
			<button onClick={clickHandler}>++</button>
			<div>{state.parity ? "even" : "odd"}</div>
		</>
	);
};

<Demo>
	<Parity2 />
</Demo>

The `useReducer()` hook has similar syntax to `useState()`. The difference,
however, is that it gives us a better handle on state changes. The syntax:

<Plot
	geo={[
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "\\texttt{const [$s$,$d$] = useReducer($r$, $obj$)}",
			xy: [-4, 6],
			fill: "var(--blue)",
		},
		{ type: "label", id: "\\text{state identifier}", xy: [-4, -0.3] },
		{ type: "line", start: [-1.85, 0], end: [-1.85, 5.3] },
		{ type: "label", id: "\\text{dispatch function}", xy: [-4, 8.8] },
		{ type: "line", start: [-1.3, 6], end: [-1.3, 8] },
		{ type: "label", id: "\\text{reducer function}", xy: [1, 1.8] },
		{ type: "line", start: [3.2, 2], end: [3.2, 5.4] },
		{ type: "label", id: "\\text{state object}", xy: [3, 8.7] },
		{ type: "line", start: [4.4, 8], end: [4.4, 6] },
	]}
	containerHeight={"55%"}
	marginTop={0}
	noAxes={true}
	id={"useReducerSyntax"}
/>

In the syntax above, ${obj}$ (the state object) is an object containing the
states we want to mutate in our component. This object is bound to the
identifier ${s}$ (the state identifier). To modify the state object, we use
the reducer function ${r.}$ This is a function with the following syntax:

<Plot
	geo={[
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "\\texttt{r($s$, $a$)}",
			xy: [-1.2, 6],
			fill: "var(--blue)",
		},
		{ type: "label", id: "\\text{action object}", xy: [-1.2, 3] },
		{ type: "line", start: [0.36, 3.1], end: [0.36, 5.4] },
		{ type: "label", id: "\\text{state object}", xy: [-2, 8.8] },
		{ type: "line", start: [-0.5, 5.9], end: [-0.5, 8] },
	]}
	containerHeight={"38%"}
	noAxes={true}
	marginTop={0}
	id={"reducerFunctionSyntax"}
/>

Above, ${s}$ is the state identifier we used earlier. This is what gives
the reducer function access to the previous state. The second parameter is
an action object. This object essentially allows the reducer function to
run through the list of states, comparing this object against each list
entry (in our example, this is done with a switch statement). If it
encounters a matching entry, it performs that entry's associated procedure.

To actually execute the reducer function, we call the dispatch function
${d.}$ The dispatch function has the syntax ${d(a),}$ where ${a}$ is the
action object earlier-mentioned.

### UseEffect

Arguably, the most powerful and oft-used hook is `UseEffect()`.
