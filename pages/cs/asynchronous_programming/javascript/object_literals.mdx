# Object-literals

If there's anything about JavaScript that merits slander, it's the way it
uses the word "object." Across most languages, the word "object" refers to
an instance of an abstract data type (e.g., in languages like Java and
Python, an instance of a particular class). JavaScript also uses this
semantic, but confusingly uses the word "object" to refer to any collection
of individual data items. In other programming languages, the JavaScript
object data structure would be given one of many specific names: `struct`,
`record`, or `aggregate`. The JavaScript object data structure is more
broadly referred to as a _record data type_, or simply a _record_.

There are two interpretations for the word "object" in JavaScript, and we
will resolve the ambiguity by using different terms. When we use the word
"object" alone, we are referring to a collection of values. When we use the
word "object-literal," we are referring to a record-type data structure
similar to a `struct`.

Recognizing this ambiguity, some JavaScript developers use the term
"object-literal". This doesn't fix the issue entirely, but we'll use this
terminology to resolve ambiguities between the object data structure and
the broader notion of an object: An **object-literal** is a record-type
data structure. We raise this issue now because many JavaScript newcomers,
especially those with previous OOP experience, mistakenly adopt a notion
that JavaScript's object-literal is an instance of some class. It is not.
It is a record data type like a `struct`. That said, an object-literal is a
collection of **properties** or **methods**.[^object_note]

[^object_note]:
    For those coming from Java: The object is not a _class_. It is more
    like a `struct` in C++.

The object-literal is analogous to the Python _dictionary_.An
object-literal's property consists of a **key-value pair**—a key (think of
it as a label, or identifier), and the data paired with it. We call the
key's name the **property name**. The value paired to the key is called the
**property value**. With object-literals, the name of a key is always a
value of one of three types:

1. String
2. Number
3. Symbol

We can think of the object-literal as akin to a stack of shelves. Each
shelf has a label—the key—and an item on that shelf—the value. The label
and the item together constitute a single shelf—the property.

We will use string value keys first, and later examine number and symbol.
Importantly, records like the object-literal are distinct from classes in
OOP. They're an older type of data structure, tracing their origins to C.
We use object-literals to represent situations in the real world where
independent pieces of data are all part of single, unified structure.
Unlike the array, records are often of different types and are identified
by name rather than index.

For example, suppose we have some data for velocity, acceleration,
momentum, and weight. Now suppose that we have the same exact kind of data
for another event. If we modeled the data, we might generate the following
table:

| Reading | velocity | acceleration | momentum | weight |
| ------- | -------- | ------------ | -------- | ------ |
| 1       | 1.14     | 1.09         | 2.33     | 13.4   |
| 2       | 1.26     | 1.05         | 2.43     | 13.9   |

How do we store this data? One option is to store each of the values
individually with their own variables. The problem: While that may work for
a handful of data values, it would quickly become cumbersome, even
infeasible, for thousands of data values.

Another option is to use an array. We still have a problem: This would
still be tedious. We would need some sort of key (with comments),
distinguishing between the data and distinguishing between the events.

The solution to this problem is to use an object literal. Object literals
allow us to group data together, but more importantly, rather than relying
on each of the data value's index, we can **label** the data. By labeling
the data, we can access the assigned values with custom keys, rather than
with an index.

Object-literals contain a **key-value pair**. A **key** is an identifier
mapped to a unique **value**. That key can be defined more than once, but
it can only have one value in any given _execution context_. That value
itself can be numeric data, textual data, an array, or more key-value
pairs. The object literal is a **collection** of these key-value pairs.

JavaScript's object-literal syntax is more broadly referred to as
**JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)**. In JSON, we specify objects simply
by listing its contents in a sequence of name-value pairs. The name and the
value are separated by a colon, the name-value pairs are separated by
commas, and the entire list of name-value pairs is enclosed in curly
braces. Here's a simple, but very useful object-literal—the abstract data
type of a **point**:

```javascript
let p1 = { x: 0, y: 0 };
```

Notice that we didn't actually surround the keys with double quotes. While
keys must be strings, we do not have to explicitly declare them as strings.
JavaScript will coerce these values into strings. We can, however,
explicitly declare them as strings. This in turn allows us to have
"identifiers" with spaces and other characters we typically aren't
permitted:

```javascript
let p1 = {
	"x-coordinate": 0,
	"y-coordinate": 0,
	"point label": "Point 1",
};
```

We can then access the values with square-bracket syntax:

```javascript
let p1 = {
	"x-coordinate": 0,
	"y-coordinate": 0,
	"point label": "Point 1",
};
console.log(p1["x-coordinate"]);
console.log(p1["y-coordinate"]);
console.log(p1["point label"]);
```

```bash
0
0
Point 1
```

Object-literals can also store arrays (and even other object literals).
Returning to our previous data table example:

```javascript
let experiment = {
	velocity: [1.14, 1.26],
	acceleration: [1.09, 1.05],
	momentum: [2.33, 2.43],
	weight: [13.4, 13.9],
};
```

Compared to object-literals, arrays are strict and sharp—they order data
strictly by index. Object-literals, on the other hand, are more fluid-like.
As a data structure, they morph into whatever we put into the object.

As can be seen above, just like an array, when an object-literal is
assigned to a variable, the variable does not store the object itself—it
stores the object's reference. There are many different kinds of objects.
For this section, we focus on how to create **object literals**. The
_object literal_ takes the following form:

```rust
<object-name> = {
	<key>: <value>,
	<key>: <value>,
	<key>: <value>,
	...
	<key>: <value>
};
```

When an object literal is created, the keys are automatically converted
into strings (except for symbols). Just like arrays, when a variable is
assigned an object, the variable does not actually store the object; it
stores the object's reference. Thus, if you assign _object $w$_ to a
variable $x$, then also assign $x$ to another variable $y$, you can make
changes to _object $w$_ with both variables $x$ and $y$. This is because
both variables are pointing to the same object.

## Numbers as Keys

Alongside strings, number values can also be used as keys. Specifically,
the number must a positive number, but it can be float. For example:

```javascript
const topCities = {
	0: "Chicago",
	1: "New York City",
	2: "Los Angeles",
	3: "London",
};
```

Accessing the values, we must use square-bracket syntax:

```javascript
const topCities = {
	0: "Chicago",
	1: "New York City",
	2: "Los Angeles",
	3: "London",
};
console.log(topCities[0]);
```

```bash
Chicago
```

Notice the syntax for accessing the value. Look familiar? Arrays are, in
fact, object-literals in JavaScript. The syntax we use to initialize arrays
is really just syntactic sugar for writing something like the above.

## The Ordering of an Object-literal's Properties

If an object-literal contains only numbers, as keys, the keys (and their
paired values) are ordered numerically from least to greatest. If, however,
the keys contain either (a) only strings or (b) strings and numbers, then
the keys (and their paired values) are ordered by insertion: The first item
we inserted is first, and the last item we inserted is last.

## Accessing an Object-literal's Data

There are two ways to access an object-literal's data. One is through dot
notation:

```rust
<object>.<key>
```

The other is through square-bracket-notation:

```rust
<object>[<key>]
```

For example:

```javascript
let experiment = {
	velocity: [1.14, 1.26],
	acceleration: [1.09, 1.05],
	momentum: [2.33, 2.43],
	weight: [13.4, 13.9],
};
console.log(experiment.velocity);
console.log(experiment["momentum"]);
```

```bash
[1.14, 1.26]
[2.33, 2.43]
```

The form `<object>[<key>]` (square bracket syntax), is necessary if the
field name is not a simple identifier or if the name is computed by the
program.

## Dynamically Accessing Properties

Because we can place expressions inside the brackets for square-bracket
syntax, we can dynamically access properties in objects. For example:

```javascript
function parity(n) {
	if (n % 2 == 0) {
		return "a";
	} else {
		return "b";
	}
}
const obj = {
	a: "Even",
	b: "Odd",
};
console.log(obj[parity(2)]);
console.log(obj[parity(3)]);
```

```bash
Even
Odd
```

Above, we passed a function call into the square brackets to access the
properties of the object `obj`. With this idiom, we can write functions
that take user inputs and return object properties.

## Modifying an Object-literal

Because a variable assigned with an object-literal only stores the object's
reference, we can change an object's properties by simply assigning new
values to the properties:

```javascript
let experiment = {
	velocity: [1.14, 1.26],
	acceleration: [1.09, 1.05],
	momentum: [2.33, 2.43],
	weight: [13.4, 13.9],
};
console.log(experiment.velocity);

experiment.velocity[0] = 0.76;

console.log(experiment.velocity);
```

```bash
[1.14, 1.26]
[0.76, 1.26]
```

To add a property, we write the following:

```javascript
let experiment = {
	velocity: [1.14, 1.26],
	acceleration: [1.09, 1.05],
	momentum: [2.33, 2.43],
	weight: [13.4, 13.9],
};
console.log(experiment);
experiment.temperatureIncreasing = true;
console.log(experiment);
```

```bash
{velocity: Array(2), acceleration: Array(2), momentum: Array(2), weight: Array(2)}

{velocity: Array(2), acceleration: Array(2), momentum: Array(2), weight: Array(2), temperatureIncreasing: true}
```

To remove a property in the object-literal, we use the keyword `delete`:

```javascript
let experiment = {
	velocity: [1.14, 1.26],
	acceleration: [1.09, 1.05],
	momentum: [2.33, 2.43],
	weight: [13.4, 13.9],
};
console.log(experiment);
delete experiment.weight;
console.log(experiment);
```

```bash
{velocity: Array(2), acceleration: Array(2), momentum: Array(2), weight: Array(2)}
{velocity: Array(2), acceleration: Array(2), momentum: Array(2)}
```

## Object-array Equality

Recall that the _strict equality operator_ `===` tests whether two values
are strictly equal in both value and type.

Because of the way objects and arrays are stored (i.e., only their
references are stored), neophytes are often surprised when two arrays or
objects, consisting of entirely the same values, value types, and keys, are
not strictly equal.

```javascript
let primes = [1, 3, 5, 7];
let morePrimes = [1, 3, 5, 7];
primes === morePrimes; // This returns false
primes == morePrimes; // Still false

/*
This is happening because the arrays _primes_ and _morePrimes_ have different references. The strict equality operator is not checking the actual arrays, it's only checking the references, and those references are different.
*/

// To check whether the arrays are strictly equal, we must ensure that both _primes_ and _morePrimes_ are storing the same reference:
let morePrimes2 = primes;
morePrimes2 === primes; // This returns true
morePrimes2 == primes; // This returns true

// From the above, if we make changes to morePrimes2, we change the array assigned to primes, since both variables are pointing to the same array:
morePrimes2.push(11);
/*
Now the array looks like: 
primes = [1, 3, 5, 7, 11]
*/
```

## Factories

JSON notation is compact and easy to read, but we can do better. We can
write functions that create object literals. We call such functions
**factories**. By convention, these functions have names beginning with an
uppercase initial letter to distinguish them from other functions. For
example, here's a function that returns a 3-dimensional point, with a
default point of `(0,0,0)`:

```javascript
function Point3d(x, y, z) {
	if (x === undefined) {
		x = 0;
		y = 0;
		z = 0;
	}
	return { x: x, y: y, z: z };
}
let point1 = Point3d(1, -4, 9);
console.log(point1);
```

```bash
{x: 1, y: -4, z: 9}
```

## Shorthand Properties of Objects

Suppose we have variables declared and initialized with values. In many
situations, we might want to create an object where the key name is the
name of the variable, and the key's assigned property is the value assigned
to the variable. **Shorthand properties** provide a concise way of creating
such an object. For example, one common idiom is to collect all of the
results from a function in an object. Say we have an array of voltage
values from an experiment. We then create a function computing various
statistics from the the values:

```javascript
const experiment1 = [0.53, 0.58, 0.59, 0.53, 0.61, 0.51, 0.53];
const experimentStats = (arr) => {
	const voltageQuantity = arr.length;
	const maxVoltage = math.max(...arr);
	const minVoltage = math.min(...arr);
	const sumVoltages = arr.reduce((sumVoltages, r) => sumVoltages + r);
	const averageVoltage = sumVoltages / voltageQuantity;
	const sortVoltageAscending = arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);

	return {
		maximumVoltage: maxVoltage,
		minimumVoltage: minVoltage,
		averageVoltage: averageVoltage,
		voltagesAscending: sortVoltageascending,
	};
};
console.log(experimentstats(experiment1));
```

```bash
{
	maximumVoltage: 0.61,
	minimumVoltage: 0.51,
	averageVoltage: 0.5542857142857143,
	voltagesAscending: [ 0.51, 0.53, 0.53, 0.53, 0.58, 0.59, 0.61 ]
}
```

But, with _shorthand properties_, we can shorten the return statement in
the example above:

```javascript
const experiment1 = [0.53, 0.58, 0.59, 0.53, 0.61, 0.51, 0.53];
const experimentStats = (arr) => {
	const voltageQuantity = arr.length;
	const maxVoltage = math.max(...arr);
	const minVoltage = math.min(...arr);
	const sumVoltages = arr.reduce((sumVoltages, r) => sumVoltages + r);
	const averageVoltage = sumVoltages / voltageQuantity;
	const sortVoltageAscending = arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);

	return {
		maxVoltage,
		minVoltage,
		averageVoltage,
		sortVoltageascending,
	};
};
console.log(experimentstats(experiment1));
```

```bash
{
	maximumVoltage: 0.61,
	minimumVoltage: 0.51,
	averageVoltage: 0.5542857142857143,
	voltagesAscending: [ 0.51, 0.53, 0.53, 0.53, 0.58, 0.59, 0.61 ]
}
```

The catch, of course, is that we cannot use unique variable names (of
course, we can get around that by assigning those names as keys in the
first place).

## Computed Properties

_Computed properties_ allow us to write properties of an object literal
with a _dynamic key_. Recall that when use a variable name as a property
name in an object, javascript does not check whether the name is actually a
variable&mdash;it simply treats it as a string:

```javascript
const negativeCharge = -1;
const negParticle = "electron";

// if we tried to use the variable name as a property:

const particleDetails = {
	negParticle: negativeCharge,
};
console.log(particleDetails);
```

```bash
{ negParticle: -1 }
```

We see the output above because JavaScript does not check if `negParticle`
is a variable; it's simply a string. To use a variable name as a property
name while making sure that javascript evaluates it, we need to use the
`object[key]` syntax _after_ we initialize the object:

```javascript
const negativecharge = -1;
const negparticle = "electron";
const particledetails = {};
particledetails[negparticle] = negativecharge;

// test:
console.log(particledetails);
// output: { electron: -1 }
```

But, the _computed properties syntax_ provides a more a concise way of
accomplishing the same task:

```javascript
const negativecharge = -1;
const negparticle = "electron";
const particledetails = { [negparticle]: negativecharge };
// test:
console.log(particledetails); // output: { electron: -1 }
```

Notice the syntax we used, `[]`:

```javascript
const variablea = "value1";
const variableb = "value2";
const objectc = { [variablea]: variableb };
// we used the value of variablea as the key name for the value of variableb
```

We can use the _computed properties syntax_ to more concisely write a
function that adds a property. Without using the _computed properties
syntax_, the function looks like:

```javascript
// this function accepts an object, and returns a copy of that object with a new property inserted:
function propadder(obj, ky, val) {
	const objcopy = { ...obj };
	objcopy[ky] = val;
	return objcopy;
}
// let's test it on an object:
const objsample = { str: "val", num: 2 };
let objsamplenew = propadder(objsample, "bool", true);

console.log(objsamplenew); // output: { str: 'val', num: 2, bool: true }
```

Above, we used the `object[key]` syntax to add the new property. We can
write the same statements with less characters with the _computed
properties syntax_:

```javascript
const propadder = (obj, ky, val) => {
	return { ...obj, [ky]: val };
};
// test:
const objsample = { str: "val", num: 2 };
let objsamplenew = propadder(objsample, "bool", true);

console.log(objsamplenew); // output: { str: 'val', num: 2, bool: true }
```

Or, even shorter with an implicit return:

```javascript
const propadder = (obj, ky, val) => ({ ...obj, [ky]: val });
// test:
const objsample = { str: "val", num: 2 };
let objsamplenew = propadder(objsample, "bool", true);

console.log(objsamplenew); // output: { str: 'val', num: 2, bool: true }
```

## Methods: Functions in Objects

We can add functions as properties on objects. Once we add a function to an
object, it becomes a **method**. The simplest reason for why we would want
to put functions into objects is that doing so is conducive to better
organized programs, which in turn leads to more efficient and elegant code.
Recall that a function, at it is core, is just data, so it can be assigned
to variables. Likewise, it can be assigned to a key:

```javascript
// here's a function that computes the circumference of a circle:
const circumference = (r) => 2 * r * math.pi;
// we can place this in an object:
const mathfuncs = {
	circumference: circumference,
};
// once placed inside an object, we can call it with the method syntax:
console.log(mathfuncs.circumference(3)); // output: 18.84955592153876
```

In the example above, the function is written outside the object, then
later placed in the object. This is not how methods are typically written.
instead, we usually write the functions directly inside the object:

```javascript
// we can place this in an object:
const mathfuncs = {
	circumference: (circumference = (r) => 2 * r * math.pi),
	circlearea: (circlearea = (r) => math.pi * r * r),
};
// once placed inside an object, we can call it with the method syntax:
console.log(mathfuncs.circumference(4)); // output: 25.132741228718345
console.log(mathfuncs.circlearea(4)); // output: 50.26548245743669
```

Note that in the examples, we used the _arrow function_ syntax. This is not
a common way of writing functions inside objects.

## Shorthand Methods Syntax

Instead of using the key value pairs syntax, we can use the _shorthand
method syntax_:

```javascript
// we can place this in an object:
const mathfuncs = {
	circumference(r) {
		return 2 * r * math.pi;
	},
	circlearea(r) {
		return math.pi * r * r;
	},
};
// once placed inside an object, we can call it with the method syntax:
console.log(mathfuncs.circumference(4)); // output: 25.132741228718345
console.log(mathfuncs.circlearea(4)); // output: 50.26548245743669
```

## Why Should We Use Methods?

The best way to see why methods are extremely useful is by example. We want
a function that draws a card out of the deck (and makes sure that the deck
is 1 card fewer for each draw).

```javascript
// first, let's make the deck
function makeDeck() {
	const deck = []; // Make an empty deck
	const suits = ["hearts", "diamonds", "spades", "clubs"]; // The array of suits
	const values = "2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A"; // A string of values
	// Turn the string of values into an array
	for (let value of values.split(",")) {
		// For each array element, do this:
		for (let suit of suits) {
			// For each suit, do this:
			deck.push({ value, suit });
		}
	}
	return deck;
}
```

Now suppose we want to draw a card from the deck. We need to write a
function that draws the card:

```javascript
function drawCard(deck) {
	return deck.pop(); // Take a card out of the deck
}
const deck = makeDeck();
```

Let's test:

```javascript
console.log(drawCard(deck));
```

```bash
{ value: 'A', suit: 'clubs' }
```

To draw another card, we need to pass the argument again:

```javascript
console.log(drawCard(deck));
```

```bash
{ value: 'A', suit: 'spades' }

```

The problem with writing the program this way is that we have to keep
passing an argument over and over again. And what if we need to shuffle the
deck? (The pop method is just taking a card from the deck in order) ```

The above example shows a common phenomenon in programming: repetitious
code. Where there is repetitious code, there are methods laying in ambush.
The above code written inside an object:

```javascript
const deck = {
	deck: [],
	suits: ["hearts", "diamonds", "spades", "clubs"],
	values: "2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A",
	makeDeck() {
		const { suits, values, deck } = this;
		for (let value of values.split(",")) {
			for (let suit of suits) {
				deck.push({ value, suit });
			}
		}
	},
	drawCard() {
		return this.deck.pop();
	},
};
deck.makeDeck();
console.log(deck.drawCard());
```

```bash
Output: { value: 'A', suit: 'clubs' }
```

By storing the functions in an object, we've created methods, which can be
called upon over and over without having to pass repeatedly pass arguments.
By using methods, we can do even more things:

```javascript
const theDeck = {
	// create the object
	deck: [], // Variable stores deck
	drawnCards: [], // Variable stores drawn cards
	suits: ["hearts", "diamonds", "spades", "clubs"], // the suits
	values: "2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A", // the ranks
	// Method: make deck
	makeDeck() {
		const { suits, values, deck } = this; // stop writing 'this' repeatedly
		// loop through 'values' string turned into array
		for (let value of values.split(",")) {
			// for each element in 'values', loop through 'suits'
			for (let suit of suits) {
				// for each suit, push this object into 'deck'
				deck.push({ value, suit });
			}
		}
	},
	// Method: draw card
	drawCard() {
		const card = this.deck.pop(); // Store drawn card in variable
		this.drawnCards.push(card); // Store drawn card in the drawnCards array
		return card; // Output card
	},
	// Method: draw multiple cards
	drawCards(numCards) {
		const cards = []; // Store drawn cards in variable
		// run drawCard this many times
		for (let i = 0; i < numCards; i++) {
			cards.push(this.drawCard()); // Put drawn cards in cards variable
		}
		return cards; // Output cards
	},
	// Method: shuffle cards
	shuffle() {
		const { deck } = this;
		// Loop through the array backwards
		for (let i = deck.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
			// Pick a random index before the current element
			let j = Math.floor(Math.random() * [i + 1]);
			// Swap elements with destructuring
			[deck[i], (deck[j] = deck[j]), deck[i]];
		}
	},
};
```

Let's test:

```javascript
theDeck.makeDeck();
console.log(theDeck.drawCard());
console.log(theDeck.drawnCards);
console.log(theDeck.drawCards(3));
theDeck.shuffle();
console.log(theDeck.drawCard());
```

```bash
{ value: 'A', suit: 'clubs' }
[ { value: 'A', suit: 'clubs' } ]
[
	{ value: 'A', suit: 'spades' },
	{ value: 'A', suit: 'diamonds' },
	{ value: 'A', suit: 'hearts' }
]
{ value: 'K', suit: 'clubs' }

```

## Objects in Memory

Suppose we wrote the following code:

```javascript
const taxpayer1 = {
	name: "Al Capone",
	age: 48,
	married: true,
};
```

Question: How is this object stored in memory? First, it's helpful to
identify the different parts of the expression above:

1. There's an identifier, `user1`.
2. There's a collection of properties:
   1. The key `taxpayer1` is paired with the string value `"Al Capone"`.
   2. The key `age` is paired with the number value `48`.
   3. The key `married` is paired with the Boolean value `false`.

Earlier, we said that we can think of the object as a collection of
shelves. Accordingly, from a higher-level view, we can visualize the object
above as such:

<Fig

	}
	caption={"JavaScript object at a low level"}
	width={"50"}
	imwidth={"374"}
	imheight={"376"}
/>

A lower-level view, however, would show that the variable `taxpayer1` is
actually bound to a reference to the object, and the object itself is a
collection of references to the properties:

		"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1653710596/cs/js_object_ref_hwth2u.svg"
	}
	caption={"JavaScript object reference"}
	width={"50"}
	imwidth={"564"}
	imheight={"376"}
/>

## The Ubiquity of Objects in JavaScript

Part of the reason why JavaScript falls into the problem of using the word
"object" confusingly is because everything boils down to the mechanics
behind object-literals. The exception to this general rule is the primitive
data types:

1. String
2. Number
3. Boolean
4. Undefined
5. null
6. Symbol

There is, however, an exception to the exception: Some of the primitive
data types have object wrapper that makes them behave like an
object-literal in certain situations. For example, the `String` data type
has an object wrapper, which includes the `length` property.
