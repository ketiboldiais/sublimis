# Variable Scope in Java

As we saw with conditional statements, blocks of code in Java are a set of
statements. They are enclosed by braces:

```java
if (...) {
	// a block of code
}
```

A block of code is essentially a "mini" program inside a bigger program.
And because they are effectively sub-programs, there are rules about what
we can and cannot do inside or outside blocks of code. In particular:
Variables declared _inside_ the block are not visible _outside_ the block.
Once we leave the block of code, Java can no longer see that variable—the
variable is no longer available for us to access. It is only accessible
inside the block.

Inversely, if a variable is declared _outside_ a block, then the variable
is visible _inside_ the block. If we declare a variable outside the block,
then Java can see that variable inside the block.

```java
int outsideBlock = 1
if (true) {
	int insideBlock = 10;
	System.out.println(outsideBlock);
}
System.out.println(insideBlock);
```

```bash
Line 6: error: cannot find symbol
System.out.println(inside);
						^
symbol:   variable inside
1 error
```

We get an error because we are telling Java to print the value assigned to
a variable it cannot see. Once we left the `if` statement's
block—`insideBlock`'s _enclosing block_ (also called _enclosing
scope_)—`insideBlock` no longer exists for all intents and purposes.
However, we can still access `outsideBlock` because it exists outside the
`if` statement's block:

```java
int outsideBlock = 1
if (true) {
	int insideBlock = 10;
	System.out.println(outsideBlock);
}
```

```bash
1
```

This inside-outside-block affair is an implication of **scope**. The scope
of a variable refers to the areas of a program where we can refer to the
variable by name. Outside of the variable's scope, we _cannot_ refer to the
variable by name. Scope is precisely why programming languages require, or
encourage, indentation. Assuming we follow proper indentation like the
examples above, the general rule of thumb is: We _can_ access variables "to
the left" or on the same level; we _cannot_ access variables "to the
right." (Where the directions are relative to the start of the line).
