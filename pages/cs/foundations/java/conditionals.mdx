The values `true` and `false` of type `boolean` are the building blocks of
computer decision-making. This due to the way computers make decision
&mdash; they take complex expressions and reduce them to true or false
evaluations.

## Comparisons in Java

In Java, we can compare variables against either literal values or other
values. This forms the basis for simple decision making. They return `true`
or `false`, values of type `boolean`:

```java
int num = 10;
System.out.println(num == 0);
System.out.println(num != 0);
System.out.println(num != 10);
System.out.println(num < 10);
System.out.println(num <= 10);
System.out.println(num > 10);
System.out.println(num >= 10);
```

```bash
false
true
false
false
true
false
true
```

The code above demonstrates Java's comparison operators:

| Operator | Computation Requested        |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| `a == b` | Is `a` equal to              |
| `b`?     |
| `a != b` | Is `a` not equal to          |
| `b`?     |
| `a < b`  | Is `a` less than             |
| `b`?     |
| `a <= b` | Is `a` less than or equal to |
| `b`?     |
| `a > b`  | Is `a` greater than          |
| `b`?     |
| `a >= b` | Is `a` greater than or equal |
| `b`?     |

## Comparing Variables

We can also compare two variables:

```java
int firstNum = 1;
int secondNum = 2;
System.out.println(firstNum > secondNum);
System.out.println(firstNum < secondNum);
```

```bash
false
true
```

## Comparing Variables with Arithmetic

We can also compare results from computations involving variables directly:

```java
int firstNum = 1;
int secondNum = 2;
System.out.println(firstNum + secondNum == 3);
System.out.println(firstNum - secondNum <= 2);
```

```bash
true
true
```

## Connecting Comparisons

We can connect a comparison expression with another comparison express to
form a compound comparison. This is done with the `and` operator (`&&`) and
the `or` operator (`||`). There are two rules that always apply when using
these two operators, stemming directly from logic:

> Given Boolean expressions $p$ and ${q,}$ the compound expression
> ${p \texttt{ \&\& } q}$ returns `true` if, and only if, both $p$ returns
> `true` and $q$ returns `true`.

> Given Boolean expressions $p$ and ${q,}$ the compound expression
> ${p \texttt{ || } q}$ returns `false` if, and only if, both $p$ returns
> `false` and $q$ returns `false`.

For example:

```java
int num = 10;
System.out.println(num > 5 && num < 10);
System.out.println(num < 10 && num > 5);
System.out.println(num > 10 || num > 5);
System.out.println(num > 10 || false);
```

```bash
false
false
true
false
```

## Evaluation Order & Grouping

Suppose we have the following Boolean expression:

$$
	p \texttt{ \&\& } q \texttt{ \&\& } (r \texttt{ || } (s \texttt{ \&\& } t))
$$

Java applies severaly rules for dealing with these complicated expressions.
First, Boolean expressions are always evaluated from left to right. Second,
as soon as Java knows what the entire expression's result is, it will stop.
It will not continue evaluating the expression. If we want Java to evaluate
particular expressions first, we use parentheses. In practice, however,
these rules should not cause problems &mdash; we should not be writing
complex Boolean expressions like that above. An example:

```java
int num = 10;
System.out.println((num > 0 && num < 10) || (num == 10));
System.out.println((num > 0 && num < 10) && (num == 10));
System.out.println(num < 10 && (num == 10 || num == 10));
System.out.println(num < 10 && num == 10 || num == 10);
```

```bash
true
false
false
true
```

The last line returns `true` because the expression is evaluated from left
to right.

1. `num < 10` is `false`.
2. `num == 10` is `true`.
3. Thus, the `and` expression thus far is `false`.
4. But, that expression logically connected with `||` to the expression
   `num == 10`, which is `true`.
5. Thus, the entire expression is `true`.

## Rule

Given a compound Boolean expression $p$ in Java, $p$ is always evaluated
from left to right. If $p$ contains parentheses, then the expressions
contained in the parentheses are evaluated first. Else or therein, the
expressions are evaluated in the following order:

1. The unary operators are evaluated (`++, --, -, !, ~, !`).

2. The mulplicative operators are evaluated (`*, /, %`).

3. The additive operators are evaluated (`+ -`).

4. The relational operators (`<, >, <=, >=`) are evaluated.

5. The equality operators (`==, !=`) are evaluated.

6. The logical `AND` operator (`&&`) is evaluated.

7. The logical `OR` operator (`||`) is evaluated.

8. The ternary operator (`? :`) is evaluated.

9. The assignment operators (`=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=`) are evalauted last.

## Querying Data

With the comparison operators, Java can make simple decisions:

```java
int num = 10;
if (num > 20) {
	System.out.println("num is greater than 20");
} else {
	System.out.println("num is not greater than 20")
}
```

```bash
num is not greater than 20
```

When we combine keywords `if` and `else`, we produce _conditional
statements_. These statements tell Java to execute a _code block_ &mdash; a
set of statements &mdash; if, and only if, a specified condition is true.
Every single computer makes decisions using this general structure,
`if-else`. As an aside, note the indentation in the example above. This
indentation must be used in Java.

With the `else if` keyword, we can produce more complex conditional
statements:

```java
int num = 0;
if (num == 1) {
	System.out.println("if block executed");
} else if (num < 1) {
	System.out.println("first else if block executed");
} else if (num > 1) {
	System.out.println("second else if block executed");
} else {
	System.out.println("else block executed");
}
```

```bash
first else if block executed
```

The code outputs as expected. Each of the conditional statements are
evaluated one by one, top to bottom. If a conditional statement's condition
returns `false`, then Java moves to the next conditional statement. The
very last statement, an `else` statement, is called a _false block_. Think
of the `else` statement as the default rule, and the statements before it
as the exceptions &mdash; if none of the `if` or `else if`s return `true`,
then the `else` applies.

A critical point: As soon as one of the conditional statements returns
`true`, the conditional statements thereafter are never run:

```java
int num = 0;
if (num == 0) {
	System.out.println("if block executed");
} else if (num < 1) {
	System.out.println("first else if block executed");
} else if (num > 1) {
	System.out.println("second else if block executed");
} else {
	System.out.println("else block executed");
}
```

```bash
if block executed
```

Here we changed the first conditional statement to `num == 0`. This returns
`true`, so Java goes into that _arm_, or _branch_, of the program. Java
does not enter any of the other arms. Java will move to the next statements
to execute, whether that's inside the conditional statement's code block or
outside the branches. Note what this means: If there is an `else`
statement, then there is _exactly one_ conditional statement executed. If
there is no `else` statement, then there is either (a) no conditional
statements executed, or (b) _at most one_ conditional statement executed.

## Nested Conditionals

We can nest conditional statements inside conditional statements to create
more complex branching:

```java
int num = 3;
if (num == 0) {
	System.out.println("I am 0!");
} else if (num > 0) {
	if (num == 1) {
		System.out.println("I am 1!");
	} else if (num == 2) {
		System.out.println("I am 2!");
	} else {
		System.out.println("I am positive, but not 0, 1, or 2!");
	}
} else if (num < 0) {
	System.out.println("I am a negative!");
} else {
	System.out.println("I am a positive!");
}
```

```bash
I am positive, but not 0, 1, or 2!
```

## Switch Statements

A branching structure consisting of `if` and `else-if` statements can be
reduced to _switch statements_:

```java
// This structure:
if (condition_A) {
	...
} else if (condition_B) {
	...
} else if (condition_C) {
	...
};

// is equivalent to:
switch (variable) {
	case A:
		...
	case B:
		...
	case C:
		...
	default:
		...
}
```

Switch statements are common in many languages, but some languages
implement them much more efficiently and powerfully. Java is not one of
those languages. Switch statements are somewhat limited in Java, and they
are not nearly as commonly seen in Java programs compared to say, Haskell
programs. For example, switch statements in Java are inherently limited to
the `variable` component above. That `variable` can only be a primitive
type or a `string`. However, compared to `if` and `else-if` statements,
switch statements can match multiple cases in a single `switch` statement
(i.e., a switch statement can have multiple arms, while the formers
cannot).

There is a nuance to the way switch statements work that can lead to
frustration: The execution starts at a matching case statement, then
continues until a `break` statement is reached. In other words, the case
analysis will not stop at the first match. It will continue testing. For
this reason, we often must include a break at each case.

Finally, notice the `default` case at the last line above. This means what
it says: If none of the cases return `true`, Java will execute that
particular line.

```java
int test = 2;
switch (test) {
	case 0: System.out.println("A");
	case 1: System.out.println("B");
	case 2: System.out.println("C");
	case 3: System.out.println("D");
	default: System.out.println("E");
}
```

```bash
C
D
E
```

Notice how Java continued execution after the match. To ensure only the
test `case 2` is executed, we need a break statement:

```java
int test = 2;
switch (test) {
	case 0: System.out.println("A");
	case 1: System.out.println("B");
	case 2: System.out.println("C");
		break;
	case 3: System.out.println("D");
	default: System.out.println("E");
}
```

```bash
C
```
