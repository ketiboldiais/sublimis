Programs need data. To give our programs that data, they must be stored
somewhere in memory. But before we store any data in Java, we must tell
Java beforehand that you are going to store data. To do so, we need
**variables**—an entity that holds a data type value. In Java, every
variable has a **name** and a **data type**.[^note_data_type]

```java
// Declare variable named c of type char
char c;

// Declare variable named num of type int
int num;

// Declare variable named isPresent of type boolean
boolean isPresent;
```

[^note_data_type]:
    A **data type** is a finite set of values and the operations on those
    values. For example, the data type `int` consists of values: integers
    ${-2^{31}}$ to ${2^{31}-1.}$ And it consists of operations: addition,
    subtraction, multiplication, division, comparison, etc.

In the example above, there are _comments_, denoted by two forward slashes
(`//`). Every other statement is called a **declaration**. The left side is
the variable's **type**, and the right side the variable's **name**. Simply
put, variable declaration is the act of creating a variable.

In programming, a comment is a statement ignored by the compiler. Because
they're ignored by the compiler, we can use them to annotate our code.
Comments are valuable in programming. They tell readers what a particular
statement means or does. But, they also take up space and too many comments
can clutter a program, making it unreadable.

Comments should be concise and descriptive. They should not be simply
identical to the actual code (since that would simply be a waste of space).

A brief note on terminology: There are different kinds of variables in
Java. Variables that store primitive type values are called **primitive
variables** (or, **primitive constants**). Variables that store objects are
called **object references**. With an object reference, the variable
doesn't actually hold the object—it instead holds a reference to the
object.

## Constants

Variables fall into two categories: (1) variables, and (2) constants. In
languages like Java, the values we store in a variable can be mutated.
Accordingly, the term variable, on its own, usually implies that the value
stored in the variable can be mutated (again, in the context of Java; some
languages do not permit such mutation). When we use the term _constant_,
however, we are referring to a variable whose stored value _cannot_ be
changed.

## Types

Data comes in many forms. The "Call me Ishmael" and "WARNING" are textual
data. The number of users visiting this page is numeric data. These data
all take a different form, and there are things we can and cannot do with
them. We can add 4 and 7, but we cannot divide "love" by "children" (at
least not logically). Because of this fact, Java (and many other
programming languages) classify data by type.

While a program runs, and while a file is open, it is stored in a hardware
component called the RAM ("Random Access Memory"). When you install
programs and save files (and they are not running or open), they are stored
in a different hardware component, the `hard drive` (or _hard disk_ or
_solid state disk_; or a CD; or a USB; devices that store data, other than
RAM). Devices like hard drives do not require electricity to store data.
RAM, however, does. It is much faster than a hard drive, because it is a
purely electronic device—unlike hard drives, there are no moving parts.
With RAM, we have the ability to very quickly open files and execute
programs, because everything is electric. This is why we lose data when our
computer suddenly dies midway through writing a Word Document or a C
program. The data is stored in RAM, and without electricity coming from the
computer's power source, everything is lost.

At a very high level overview, the RAM can be understood as:

	imheight={"269"}
/>

Whenever we declare a variable in Java, we must explicitly state the
variable's type. This is an instruction to the compiler that the particular
variable will store a value of a particular type. We will see later why
Java's designers decided to implement this feature.

Now, once we declare a variable to be of a particular type, that variable's
type can never change. For example, when write `int x;` the variable `x`
will always store some value of type `int`. That value may change later,
but the variable's type `int` can never be changed to `double` or `char`.
Because of this trait—the prohibition of changing a variable's type after
declaration—Java is described as a **statically-typed language** (i.e., the
language's types are "static").[^typing_note]

[^typing_note]:
    The other end of the spectrum are the **dynamically-typed languages**
    like JavaScript; in these languages, a variable can store an integer,
    then later store a Boolean, then later store a string. Furthermore,
    type checking is done at runtime—**dynamic type checking**.

Whenever we compile Java source code, the `javac` compiler will check all
of our source code to ensure we are complying with Java's type-checking
rules. Because type checking is done at compile time, we say that Java
employs a **static type checking** system.

With few exceptions relating to scope—in Java, once you have declared a
variable name of a particular type, you cannot redeclare it later down the
program:

```java
// Declare variable named c of type char
char c;

// Variable is already declared, this will return an error
char c;

// This also won't work, even if it's of different type
int c;
```

Even if the last example worked, it would be a stark example of _dirty
code_, poor programming hygiene. How will our future selves or other coders
tell the two apart?

In Java, there are eight **primitive data types**. All other data in Java
is represented by some combination of these eight primitive types. The
types fall into four broad categories:

1. integers
2. floating point numbers
3. text
4. booleans

A helpful way to think about types is to imagine them as cups. They hold
something. For example, at a coffee shop, drinks can be ordered in various
sizes. Suppose the sizes are small, short, tall, grande, gigante, and
monstruoso. Some of the drink sizes are specific to certain drinks. Maybe
the monstruouso size is only available for lemonade or water—it would be
too costly to serve high quality coffee at such a size. The same idea
extends to types. As we'll see, an `int` is ${32}$ bits, a `long` is ${64}$
bits, a `char` is ${16}$ bits, and so on.

### Integer Type

Integers are the whole numbers and their negative counterparts (e.g., 0, 5,
-11, 27, etc.). In Java, these numbers can be represented by any one of
these four types:

```java
byte
short
int
long
```

We will later discuss why there are 4 different types. For now, let's
review some representation. As we know, the computer doesn't actually know
what `2` or `17` are—the computer only understands 1s and 0s. As such,
integers, written in Hindu-Arabic numerals, must be translated to binary
form for the computer to process.

#### Two's-Complement

With the natural numbers, we can convert these easily. The number ${2}$ is
${10_{[0]}}$ in binary, and ${17}$ is ${10001_{[0]}.}$ But how do we deal
with negative integers?

Let's consider the data type `byte`. As its name implies, a `byte` can only
hold 8 bits. With 8 bits, we can represent ${2^n}$ unique bit patterns,
starting from ${00000000_{[0]}}$ (0 in decimal) through ${01111111_{[0]}}$
(127 in decimal). Hang on. Why is is there ${0}$ there? Shouldn't it be
${01111111_{[0]}}$ (128)? That ${0}$ is called the **sign bit**. If the
number is positive, the sign bit is ${0,}$ and if it's negative, the sign
bit is ${1.}$

The next question, however, is how does the computer _store_ negative
integers? For example, if we wrote ${-5,}$ how does the computer go from
this literal to binary? The answer is through **two's-complement**. The
idea is fairly straightforward. Let's start with the number ${5,}$ stored
in a `byte`, and work our way to negative ${5.}$ First, we represent the
number ${5}$ in binary:

$$
	00000101_{[0]}
$$

Next, we take what we call the **one's-complement**. Essentially, we,
invert, or change, all of the digits into their opposites:

$$
	11111010_{[0]}
$$

Then, we add ${1}$ to the one's-complement:

$$
	\begin{align*} 11111010_{[0]} \\ + 00000001_{[0]} \\ \hline 11111011_{[0]} \end{align*}
$$

This result, ${11111011_{[0]},}$ is called **two's-complement**. Notice
that we now have a ${1}$ as the sign-bit. This is a negative number, but
it's not ${-5,}$ as read. We need the ${5.}$ To get the ${5,}$ we simply
take the two's-complement of ${11111011_{[0]},}$ while keeping the sign bit
in place.

As an aside, notice that when we add the binary representation of ${5}$ to
the binary representation of ${-5,}$ we get ${0:}$

$$
	\begin{align*} 00000101_{[0]} \space &(5_{[10]}) \\ + 11111011_{[0]} \space &(-5_{[10]}) \\ \hline 00000000_{[0]} \space &(0_{[10]}) \end{align*}
$$

### Floating Point Types

Floating point numbers are those numbers with fractional parts, or decimal
points (i.e., 0.0, 12.9, 3.14, -1.29, etc.) We can represent these numbers
with any one of these two types:

```java
float pi = 3.14;
double e = 0.577;
```

### Text

There are two ways to represent textual data in Java: with the primitive
type `char` or with the abstract data type `String`. We will investigate
what the differences between a primitive type and an abstract data type are
in later sections, but for now, it suffices to understand that `char` is a
primitive, but `String` is not.

The `char` type represents individual alphanumeric characters for symbols.
There are ${2^16}$ different possible `char` values; this includes letters,
numbers, symbols, and whitespace characters like single-space, tab, and
newline.

```java
char x = 'x';
String n = "Hello";
```

The `String` type represents _sequences_ of characters. In Java, we denote
strings by enclosing a sequence of characters in double quotes.

## Boolean

Boolean values are the binary values `true` and `false`. These are the only
two values under the type.

```java
boolean a = true;
boolean b = false;
```

With just these eight types:

- `byte, short, int, long`
- `float, double`
- `char`
- `boolean`

we can represent any data that a computer can work with.

## Initialization

Once we have declared a variable, we can assign it data. In doing so, we
**initialize** the variable (we give the variable an _initial_ value):

```java
// declaration
float increment;

// initialization
increment = 0.1;

// inline-initialization: declare and initialize in one line
boolean isItSnowing = false;
long weightBlueWhale = 330000;
```

In the example above, notice that we can declare and initialize variables
in one line. This is called **inline-initialization**.

Note that every statement in Java ends with a semicolon (;). Java is a
**semicolon-delimited language**. To use variables in Java, they _must_ be
initialized:

```java
double x;
System.out.println(x);
```

```bash
Line 3: error: variable x might not have been initialized
System.out.println(x);
									^
1 error
```

A **literal** is the Java source code representation of a data type value.
The number or value we explicitly assign to a variable is called a literal.
In programs, there are values that change as the program runs; an
_incrementer_ or _accumulator_, for example. Literals are those values that
are not computed; they are explicitly written. They might be manipulated,
but the value we explicitly wrote always appears directly in our source
code.

The opposite of a literal is an **expression**. An expression is a
combination of literals, variables, and operations that Java must
_evaluate_ to produce a single value. We can also think of the expression
as the Java source code representation of a computation.

```java
// These are literals
char tic = 'x';
char tac = 'o';

// Note the L suffix; this is how we tell Java that this is big number
long bigNum = 10000L;

boolean isComplete = true;
boolean isIncomplete = false;

// These are expressions, not a literal
int foo = 1 + 1;
long biggerNum = bigNum + 10000L;
```

## Modifying Variables

Once a value is assigned to a variable, we can modify it as the program
runs:

```java
int changing = 10;

changing = 20; // assign a new value

changing = 20 + 20; // Arithmetic is ok right of =

changing += 1; // Add 1, assign it the result

changing -= 1; // Subtract 1, assign it the result

changing *= 2; // Multiply by 2, assign it the result

changing /= 2; // Divide by 2, assign it the result
```

We can also modify variables by assigning existing variables. Always read
assignments from right to left:

```java
double first = 10.0;
double second = 5.0;
first = second // assignment, right to left
second = 20.0;
first = second + 10.0;
double third = 2.0;
first = second + third; // arithmetic with variables on right is ok

int z = 10;
z = z + 1; // z is now 11
```

The last example reveals a crucial point about assignment, and why we want
to always read them from right to left. The value assigned to `z` at the
very last line is first computed—`z + 1`—then assigned. The value stored in
`z` when `z + 1` is computed is `10`, so the value assigned to `z` at the
very last line is `11`.

## Type Safety

Once we declare a variable in that variable must maintain its type. We
cannot, say, declare a variable `num` of type `int`, and thereafter assign
to it data of type `float`:

```java
int num = 10;
num = 10.0; // error is returned
```

Failure to remember this rule can lead to unexpected results:

```java
int num = 35;
num /= 2;
System.out.println(num);
```

```bash
11
```

The correct answer to the above should be ${11.\overline{6}.}$ (The
overline, called a _vinculum_, indicates repeating digits). We're getting
`11` because `num` was declared to store data of type `int`. Note that
there is no rounding occurring here. Java is simply dropping the fractional
digits. Note that Strings in Java must be enclosed in double quotes:

```java
System.out.println("Hello, world!'); // causes an error
System.out.println("Hello, world!"); // no error
```

## Why "Primitive" Type?

The eight types above are referred to as "primitive" types because they can
all be represented by numbers. The numeric data types
`byte, short, int, long, float, double` can obviously all be represented by
numbers. But what about `char` and `boolean`? Well, `boolean` is simply a
binary value—we can represent `false` with `0` and `true` with `1`.

`char` is more interesting. In programming, English characters have a
corresponding numeric code called an **ASCII code**, found in the ASCII
table. Because each letter is encoded in ASCII with numbers, they too can
be represented as numbers. ASCII has generally gone along the wayside,
replaced by the much larger UNICODE enconding system. This is due to ASCII
encoding only English characters—obviously English isn't the only language
we speak.

## Strongly-typed v. Weakly-typed Languages

In many languages, like Python and JavaScript, we, the programmers, are not
required to explicitly state what types our data are. These are called
_weakly-typed languages_. Java and C, however, are _strongly-typed_
languages—we must explicitly provide a datum's type. The benefit of
strongly-typed languages: It forces us to specify how much space we need to
store data. This means we have no choice but to be efficient. Moreover, it
helps us catch some of the most common programming errors.

### Why are there are so many types?

Java provides a variety of types to manage memory and to respond to
hardware advances. Each of the types takes up a certain amount of memory.
Here's an API:

| Java Primitive Type | Bytes Required | Range                                             | Default  |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| boolean             | 1 byte         | `true`, `false`                                   | `false`  |
| byte                | 2 bytes        | ${[-128..127]}$                                   | `0`      |
| char                | 2 bytes        | ${[0..65535]}$                                    | `\u0000` |
| short               | 2 bytes        | ${[-32768..32767]}$                               | `0`      |
| int                 | 4 bytes        | ${[-2147483649..2147483647]}$                     | `0`      |
| float               | 4 bytes        | ${[-1.4 \times 10^{-45}..3.4 \times 10^{38}]}$    | `0.0f`   |
| long                | 8 bytes        | --                                                | `0`      |
| double              | 8 bytes        | ${[-4.39 \times 10^{-324}..1.7 \times 10^{308}]}$ | `0.0d`   |

But why so many? For example, `byte`, `int`, `short`, and `long` all
represent integers. But why are there four separate types? The answer is a
combination of history and economics.

First, all of the computations done by a computer are ultimately done by
the computer's CPU. Without the CPU, a computer would just be a metal
brick. Now, we might have heard of various terms like "64-bit processors"
or "32-bit processors". At the time of writing, mainstream processors are
64-bit processors. Before this, we had 32-bit processors, and before that,
16-bit processors. There were, and are, 12-bit, 8-bit, and 4-bit
processors. What do these terms mean?

In our early years, we learned to count with our fingers. 5 for five
fingers, and 10 for ten fingers. Computers also have to count, but they
don't have fingers. However, recall our discussion on representation. All
the computer really needs is two fingers to represent 0 and 1. The word
"bit," as used in "64-bit" communicates how many fingers the computer has
to count. With a 4-bit processor, the computer only has four fingers, and
it can only count up to the binary number ${1111_{[0]}}$ (15 in decimal).
With a 32-bit processor, the computer has 32 fingers, and it can count up
to the binary number

$$
	11111111111111111111111111111111_{[0]}
$$

(4,294,967,296 in decimal).

Now, recall that when we execute programs, we are really sending
instructions to the CPU. Those instructions are in 0s and 1s. The CPU,
however, has a fundamental constraint: It has a fixed size for how many 0s
and 1s it can process at once (or more formally, in one _cycle_). With a
64-bit processor, the CPU can process 64-bits of data in a single cycle.
With a 32-bit processor, 32 bits, 16-bit 16 bits, and so on. This
limitation impacts how well the computer handles large computations. For
example, we can quickly compute ${2 + 2 = 4.}$ However, with something like
${298 + 769,}$ we have to perform carry-overs. The same idea extends to
CPUs. With numbers beyond what it can handle in a single cycle, the CPU
must perform more than 1 step to complete the computation.

This limitation extends to another important part of the computer: RAM.
Recall the RAM diagram earlier. Each square in the grid has a **memory
address**, and that address is named as an integer. For example, consider a
3-bit processor. With 3 bits, the computer can only count up to ${111.}$
This in turn means that the computer can only generate 8 possible patterns
of bits: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, or 111. In terms of memory, the
computer would only be able to understand these 8 addresses. Reference
anything beyond these addresses, and the computer won't know what we're
talking about. And with that limitation, our programs can only be so large
and complex—memory is everything.

How does this all relate to Java's types? At the time Java was introduced,
mainstream processors were 32-bit processors. Accordingly, Java used 4
bytes to represent integers (8 bits in a byte, 4 bytes yields 32 bits).
This also explains why compilers for older languages like C use 2 bytes to
represent integers—at the time, 16-bit processors were the norm. To allow
programmers to write programs for older machines—called **backwards
compatibility**—Java provides `byte` and `short`. And in response to newer
machines—using 64-bit processors—Java provided `long`.

Knowing these limitations is critical when we're working with data types of
small value ranges. Failing to recall them can lead to unexpected results:

```java
class Overflow {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		byte num = 10;
		num += 256;
		System.out.println(num);
	}
}
```

```bash
10
```

Why isn't the console displaying `356`? Because the type `byte` is
restricted to exactly 1 byte—it can only store integers up to 256. Once we
go beyond `256`, go back to `0`. In programming, this is called
**overflow**. We can prevent encountering overflows by testing for the
type's `MIN_VALUE` and `MAX_VALUE`.

## Operators

Operators are evaluated in a specific order. Parentheses are always
evaluated first. Inside the parentheses or otherwise, operators are
evaluated left-to-right. Going from left to right, multiplication (`*`) and
modulus (`%`) are evaluated before addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`).
Below is an API of the various operators in Java, where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are
variables or literals.

### Addition

> `a+b`

The addition operator is straightforward. It computes ${a + b,}$ where
${a}$ and ${b}$ are numeric types or `char`. If ${a}$ and ${b}$ are
strings, then the strings are _concatenated._

### Subtraction

> `a-b`

Another basic operation is subtraction—compute ${a - b}$, where ${a}$ and
${b}$ are numeric types or `char`.

### Multiplication

> `a * b`

Multiplication — ${a \times b}$ — is done with the asterisk or star symbol.
In Java ${a}$ and ${b}$ are numeric types or `char`.

### Division

> `a / b`

Division — ${\dfrac{a}{b}}$ — is done with the forward slash character.
${a}$ and ${b}$ are numeric types or `char`.

### Remainder

> `a % b`

The percentage sign corresponds to the remainder operator. It computes:

$$
	\dfrac{a}{b}
$$

and returns the remainder. ${a}$ and ${b}$ are numeric types.

### Increment

> `a++`

The increment operator computes ${a + 1.}$ ${a}$ is a numeric type.

### Decrement

> `a--`

The Decrement operator computes ${a - 1,}$ ${a}$ is a numeric type.

### The Less Than Symbol

> `a < b`

The less than symbol is a _relational operator_. It returns `true` if
${a < b,}$ other wise false|${a}$ is a numeric type.

### The Greater Than Symbol

> `a > b`

The greater than symbol is a relational operator. It returns `true` if
${a > b,}$ other wise false|${a}$ and ${b}$ are numeric types.

### Less than or Equal To

> `a <= b`

Another relational operator; returns `true` if ${a < b}$ or ${a = b,}$
other wise false. ${a}$ and ${b}$ are numeric types.

### Greater than or Equal To

> `a >= b`

Relational operator; returns `true` if ${a > b}$ or ${a = b,}$ other wise
false|${a}$ and ${b}$ are numeric types.

### Equality

> `a == b`

Relational operator; returns `true` if ${a = b,}$ other wise false|${a}$
and ${b}$ are numeric types.

### Non-equality

> `a != b`

Returns `true` if ${a \neq b,}$ other wise false|${a}$ is a numeric type.

### Logical AND

> `a && b`

Logical operator AND; returns `true` if ${a}$ is `true` and `b` is `true`;
otherwise false. ${a}$ and ${b}$ are of type `bool`

### Logical OR

> `a || b`

Logical operator OR; returns `true` if ${a}$ is `true` or `b` is `true`;
otherwise false. ${a}$ and ${b}$ are of type `bool`.

### Logical NOT

> `!a`

The logical operator NOT returns `false` if ${a}$ is `true`, and returns
`true` if ${a}$ is `false`. ${a}$ is of type `bool`

## Idioms

Many computer science newcomers are unfamiliar with the remainder operator.
This operator simply returns the remainder from dividing some number $a$ by
${b.}$

The remainder operator is a particularly useful operation. For example, if
${a \bmod 2}$ returns a remainder of 0, then we know that $a$ is an even
number. If ${a \bmod 2}$ returns a remainder greater than 0, then we know
that $a$ is an odd number. For example:

```java
public class Demo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int x = 4;
		int y = 5;
		boolean xIsEven = (x % 2 == 0); // xIsEven is true
		boolean yIsEven = (y % 2 == 0); // yIsEven is false
		System.out.println(xIsEven);
		System.out.println(yIsEven);
	}

```bash
true
false
```

Examining this use of the modulus operator, we can see that we can
generalize this pattern even more—write `x % 3`, and we check if `x` is a
multiple 3, `x % 4`, a multiple of 4, `x % 11` a multiple of 11, and so on.

In computer science, this is an example of a **idiom**. An idiom is just a
programming pattern. In this case, we have some pattern `${x}$ % ${n}$`,
where ${x}$ is some variable, and `${n}$` is a positive integer. Learning
and recognizing idioms is a core skill in programming; with it, we can
identify and solve smaller problems quickly. And as we'll see with
functions, the best way to approach a problem is to break it down into
smaller problems.

### Bitwise Operators

The bitwise operators operate on bits of data. Because these operators
operate on bits, they are the fastest of all operators. Below is an API of
the operators. We will present examples separately.

| Operator | Meaning                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `&`      | Bitwise `AND`; corresponds to the logical ${\land}$  |
| `\|`     | Bitwise `OR`; corresponds to the logical ${\lor}$    |
| `~`      | Bitwise `NOT`; corresponds to the logical ${\neg}$   |
| `^`      | Bitwise `XOR`; corresponds to the logical ${\oplus}$ |
| `>>`     | Bitwise `RIGHT SHIFT`                                |
| `>>>`    | Bitwise `UNSIGNED RIGHT SHIFT`                       |
| `<<`     | Bitwise `LEFT SHIFT`                                 |

The bitwise operators are analogous to computing truth tables. Let's say we
had two literals, `a` and `b.` Let's further say that `a` and `b` are
represented in binary by just a single bit. Thus, `a` and `b` can only be
`1` or `0`. The bitwise `AND` `&` performs as such:

| a   | b   | a && b |
| --- | --- | ------ |
| 0   | 0   | 0      |
| 0   | 1   | 0      |
| 1   | 0   | 0      |
| 1   | 1   | 1      |

The bitwise `OR`, `|`,

| a   | b   | a \| b |
| --- | --- | ------ |
| 0   | 0   | 0      |
| 0   | 1   | 1      |
| 1   | 0   | 1      |
| 1   | 1   | 1      |

The bitwise `XOR`, `^`,

| a   | b   | a ^ b |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| 0   | 0   | 0     |
| 0   | 1   | 1     |
| 1   | 0   | 1     |
| 1   | 1   | 0     |

and the bitwise `NOT`, `~`,

| a   | ~a  |
| --- | --- |
| 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   |

## Naming

A **name**, or more formally, an **identifier**, is a sequence of
characters in source code used to label a particular entity (for example, a
variable). In Java, names must begin with either Unicode letters and
digits, the dollar sign (`$`), or the underscore (`_`). By convention,
however, names should always begin with a letter. Names in Java also follow
camelCasing (capitalizing every other word to indicate spacing), rather
than pothole*casing (using underscores to indicating spacing). The
exception to this convention is with constants—very letter in a constant
should be in upper case, with spaces indicated by undercores. Finally, Java
places heavy emphasis on \_descriptive* and _concise_ variable names,
erring on the side of _descriptive_.

```java
// This is good
int age = 22;

// These are good
int NUM_ATTENDEES = 87;
boolean ATTENDED = true;

// This is bad
float $pi = 3.14;

```

In general, there are three guidelines we should follow when creating
variable names:

1. The variable name should describe the data stored in the variable.

2. Our code is read more times than it is written (whether by ourselves or
   others). Our priority should be "easy to understand," not "easy to
   write."

3. If there are standard conventions, follow them; else, create a name and
   be consistent.

4. Additionally, like any other programming language, there are certain
   words we cannot use as names in Java. These are called **reserved
   words**:

```rust
abstract, assert
boolean, break, byte
case, catch, char, class, const, continue
default, do, double
else, extends
false, final, finally, float, for
goto
if, implements, import, instanceof, int, interface
```

```rust
long
native, new, null
package, private, protected, public
return
short, static, strictfp, super, switch, synchronized
this, throw, throws, transient, true, try
void, volatile, while
```

## Library Methods & APIs

In the examples above, we wrote the following:

```java
System.out.print(/* some expression or value */)
```

This is a **library method**—a method provided by the Java library. There
are numerous library methods in Java; methods for mathematics, printing,
input and output, etc. Because of how many library methods there are, we
will not list and explain them all at once. Instead, we will use and
elaborate on them as needed.
