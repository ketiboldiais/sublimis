# Shells

## Basic Commands

To effectively navigate with a shell, we must first know the most basic
commands (where CWD stands for "current working directory" — the directory
we're currently in):

| Operation                                  |            Bash            |            Power Shell            |
| ------------------------------------------ | :------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |
| Tell me what the CWD is                    |           `pwd`            |          `get-location`           |
| Clear the console                          |          `clear`           |           `clear-host`            |
| Enter the directory `⟨dir⟩` inside the CWD |         `cd ⟨dir⟩`         |       `set-location ⟨dir⟩`        |
| Tell me what's inside the CWD              |            `ls`            |          `get-childitem`          |
| Copy the `⟨file⟩`                          |        `cp ⟨file⟩`         |        `copy-item ⟨file⟩`         |
| Permanently delete the `⟨file⟩`            |        `rm ⟨file⟩`         |       `remove-item ⟨file⟩`        |
| Permanently delete the directory `⟨dir⟩`   |       `rmdir ⟨dir⟩`        |        `remove-item ⟨dir⟩`        |
| Print text to the terminal window          |           `echo`           |           `write-host`            |
| Create a new `⟨file⟩` in CWD               |       `touch ⟨file⟩`       |         `new-item ⟨file⟩`         |
| Create a new directory `⟨dir⟩` in the CWD  |       `mkidr ⟨dir⟩`        |            `md ⟨dir⟩`             |
| Show the contents of `⟨file⟩`              |        `cat ⟨file⟩`        |       `get-content ⟨file⟩`        |
| Show the user manual of `⟨command⟩`        |      `man ⟨command⟩`       |       `get-help ⟨command⟩`        |
| Move or rename the `⟨dir/file⟩`            | `mv ⟨dir/file⟩ ⟨dir/file⟩` | `move-item ⟨dir/file⟩ ⟨dir/file⟩` |

## Grep

The `grep` command is one of the most powerful and useful commands in the
Bash shell. In short, it's a search command. Suppose we had a file called
`bar.md` in some directory `foo`. Inside `bar.md`, we have the following:

```terminal
Hello, world!
```

We `cd` into `foo`, and run the following:

```bash
grep world ./bar.md
Hello, world!
```

Notice how it returned the line `Hello, world!`. There are several
templates for `grep`:

<Table2 col1="Grep Command" col2="Operation">

- `grep ⟨word⟩ ⟨filename⟩`
  - Show me all the lines that exactly match `⟨word⟩` in `⟨filename⟩`
- `grep -i ⟨word⟩ ⟨filename⟩`
  - Ignoring case, show me all the lines that contain `⟨word⟩` in
    `⟨filename⟩`.
  - Note that this command will return words containing `⟨word⟩`. For
    example, searching for `colon` will return `semicolon`, `colony`, and
    `colonization`. To ignore these matches, use the `-w` flag (see next
    command below)
- `grep -w ⟨word⟩ ⟨filename⟩`
  - Show me all the lines that contain `⟨word⟩`, and only `⟨word⟩` in
    `⟨filename⟩`
- `grep -R ⟨word⟩`
  - Show me every file that contains an exact match to `⟨word⟩`
- `grep -c ⟨word⟩ ⟨filename⟩`
  - Show me the number of exact matches to `⟨word⟩` in `⟨filename⟩`

## Common Commands

Below are some useful commands for more specific use cases.

### Killing a Port Process

In development, some ports may get stuck with a process, rendering them
unusable until the process is killed. To kill the process at the port, the
following commands can be used:

| Bash                    | Power Shell                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `sudo lsof -i tcp:8000` | `netstat -ano \| findstr : ⟨port-number⟩ ` |

Running the command above yields a list of PIDs (process IDs). For example,
running the bash command on port 3000, we might get:

```bash
numerm$ lsof -i tcp:3000
COMMAND     PID         USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
Google     2926 johndoe   46u  IPv6 0x963860c55a6a286f      0t0  TCP localhost:55962->localhost:hbci (ESTABLISHED)
node      79733 johndoe   23u  IPv6 0x963860c55a6b0f4f      0t0  TCP *:hbci (LISTEN)
node      79733 johndoe   36u  IPv6 0x963860c55a6a2f4f      0t0  TCP localhost:hbci->localhost:55962 (ESTABLISHED)
```

To kill a process, we then write:

| Bash            | Power Shell              |
| --------------- | ------------------------ |
| `kill -9 ⟨PID⟩` | `taskkill /PID ⟨PID⟩ /F` |

### Get the System's Current IP Address

The commands below return the computer system's current IP address.

| Bash                     | Power Shell                            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `ipconfig getifaddr en0` | `Get-NetIPAddress -AddressFamily IPV4` |
