# Dynamic Arrays

1. [Length Fields](#length-fields)
2. [Indirection](#indirection)

In languages like Java, static arrays are objects consisting of a numbered
list of variables. Each of the variables inside the object can be one of
two things:

1. a primitive type, or
2. a reference to an object

As objects, to create an array, we must first create a reference to that
array. For example, suppose we wanted to create an array consisting of the
characters `b`, `l`, `u`, and `e`.

To obtain such an array, we first create a reference:

```java
char[] C;
```

Writing the code above, we've now created a reference `C`, which will refer
to an array of characters. Now, all the code above does is create a
reference. Java knows it will refer to some array object of characters, but
no such object exists yet. As such, we must create the array object we
want, and bind it to the reference above:

```java
char[] C;
C = new char[4];
```

Above, we've bound the reference to a new array object with a length of 4.
This results in the following:

<Sequence
	data={["", "", "", ""]}
	scale={20}
	arrayPointers={[{ target: 0, text: "C" }]}
/>

We now have four _variables_ we can assign values to. For example, writing

```java
char[] C;
C = new char[4];
C[0] = 'b';
```

results in:

<Sequence
	data={["b", "", "", ""]}
	scale={20}
	arrayPointers={[{ target: 0, text: "C" }]}
/>

writing:

```java
char[] C;
C = new char[4];
C[0] = 'b';
C[1] = 'l';
C[2] = 'u';
C[3] = 'e';
```

we get:

<Sequence
	data={["b", "l", "u", "e"]}
	scale={20}
	arrayPointers={[{ target: 0, text: "C" }]}
/>

However, the moment we write:

```java
char[] C;
C = new char[4];
C[0] = 'b';
C[1] = 'l';
C[2] = 'u';
C[3] = 'e';
C[4] = 's';
```

we get a runtime error. More specifically, we'll get an out-of-bounds
exception. Why is it a runtime error? Because Java doesn't know how long
the array is until runtime.

## Length Fields

In Java, every array object has a field called `length`. That field is
immutable — we, as Java's users, cannot assign it a value. Thus, writing
something like:

```java
C.length = 10;
```

will return a compile time error. This is because static arrays have a
fixed length — that length cannot be changed. This is the tradeoff we have
to take for constant time access.

## Indirection

One way to get around the fixed-size limitation of static arrays is to use
a **dynamically-allocated array**, or **dynamic arrays** for short.
Languages like C and C++ handle this well. Below is a comparison of
declaring the two different arrays in C++ (the right a static array, the
left dynamic):

<Grid cols={2} colgap={"5px"}>

```c
int arr[100];
```

```c
int* arr = new int[size];
```

</Grid>

The idea behind the dynamic array: Rather than directly storing a reference
to the array (as is the case with static arrays), we instead store a
_pointer_ to the array. This technique is a form of **indirection**. For
example, say we started with the following dynamic array:

<Sequence
	data={["", "", "", ""]}
	scale={30}
	arrayPointers={[{ target: 0, text: "ptr" }]}
/>

Above, we have a pointer `ptr` pointing to this array. Now suppose filled
up the array:

<Sequence
	data={["a", "b", "c", "d"]}
	scale={30}
	arrayPointers={[{ target: 0, text: "ptr" }]}
/>

If we want to add a fifth element, `e`, we'd be out of luck with a static
array. But, because we're using a dynamic array, we just have to allocate
more space elsewhere in memory:

<Grid cols={2}>

<Sequence
	data={["a", "b", "c", "d"]}
	arrayPointers={[{ target: 0, text: "ptr" }]}
	scale={50}
/>

<Sequence data={["", "", "", "", ""]} scale={60} />

</Grid>

copy over the contents of our original array:

<Grid cols={2}>

<Sequence
	data={["a", "b", "c", "d"]}
	arrayPointers={[{ target: 0, text: "ptr" }]}
	scale={50}
/>

<Sequence data={["a", "b", "c", "d", ""]} scale={60} />

</Grid>

and change our pointer's pointee:

<Grid cols={2}>

<Sequence data={["a", "b", "c", "d"]} scale={50} />

<Sequence
	data={["a", "b", "c", "d", ""]}
	arrayPointers={[{ target: 0, text: "ptr" }]}
	scale={60}
/>

</Grid>
