In the previous section, we saw **singly-linked lists**â€”linked lists whose
nodes are linked with just one link, implemented with a `next` pointer. We
now examine **doubly-linked lists**. These are lists whose nodes are linked
with _two_ links, implemented with a `next` and `prev` pointer:

<DoublyLinkedList data={[6, 3, 9, 7, 5]} />

In a singly-linked list, every node has a pointer to the next node. With
double linked lists, each node has a pointer to the next node, as well as
the previous node. And since we have links to the next node and to the
previous node, we can move forward _and_ backward.

Doubly linked lists are used for a variety of applications:

1. Implementing navigation systems where a forward and back feature is
   desired. For example, on a browser, we can move forward and back in our
   history.

2. Executing past and future procedures. Most interactive programs like
   text editors have _undo_ and _redo_ functions. These functions require
   going forward and back on the timeline of changes.

3. Recording data associated with time. For example, manipulating cache
   data in terms of most-recently-used or least-recently-used requires
   going forward and back.

4. Thread scheduling. Some operating systems implement a _thread scheduler_
   with a doubly linked list, allowing the system to determine which
   process must run at a particular time.

5. Implementing the doubly-linked list is not that much of a departure from
   implementing the singly-linked list. The key difference is that the node
   structure changes. Where the singly-linked list node consists of a
   record with just two fields `data` and `next`, the doubly-linked list
   node is comprised of a record with three fields: `prev` (a pointer to
   the previous node), `data` (the data stored in the node), and `next` (a
   pointer to the next node). Accordingly, the record would look like:

```rust
class Node:
	Node* prev
	TYPE data
	Node* next
```

```c
struct Node {
	struct Node* prev;
	int data;
	struct Node* next;
};
```

We can then write a function for instantiating new nodes:

```rust
class Node:
	Node* prev
	TYPE  data
	Node* next

	Node(val):
		prev = null
		data = val
		next = null
```

```c
struct Node* newNode(int newData) {
	struct Node* node = malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
	(*node).prev = NULL;
	(*node).data = newData;
	(*node).next = NULL;
	return node;
}
```

With the function above, we can begin creating new nodes. The next step is
to link them. Before doing so, let's briefly introduce some new notation.
When we refer to doubly-linked lists in text, we will write:

$$
	(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i)_d
$$

Where ${n}$ is a node, and ${i}$ is its position. When we refer to a
singly-linked list in text, we will write:

$$
	(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i)_s
$$

The differentiating symbol being, ${d}$ for double, and ${s}$ for single.
For circular singly-linked lists and circular doubly-linked lists, we
write:

$$
	(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i)_s^{\circ} \\[1em] (n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i)_d^{\circ}
$$

Suppose we want to implement the doubly-linked list ${(1,2,3)_d}$. So, we
create three nodes, using the code above:

```rust
	Node* root = null
	Node* node1 = new Node(1)
	Node* node2 = new Node(2)
	Node* tail  = new Node(3)
```

In C:

```c
	int main() {
		struct Node* root = NULL;
		struct Node* n1 = newNode(1);
		struct Node* n2 = newNode(2);
		struct Node* tailend = newNode(3);
		return 0;
	}
```

Then, we link the nodes:

```rust
Node* root  = null
Node* node1 = new Node(1)
Node* node2 = new Node(2)
Node* tail  = new Node(3)

root       = n1
n1->next   = n1
n2->prev   = n1
n2->next   = tail
tail->prev = n2
```

In C:

```c
int main() {
	struct Node* root = NULL;
	struct Node* n1 = newNode(1);
	struct Node* n2 = newNode(2);
	struct Node* tailend = newNode(3);

	// linking
	root = n1;
	(*n1).next = n2;
	(*n2).prev = n1;
	(*n2).next = tailend;
	(*tailend).prev = n2;
}
```

To test whether this works, let's write two functions, `printForward()` and
`printBackward()`. Using the C implementation:

```c
void printForward(struct Node* p) {
	printf("( ");
	while(p != NULL) {
		printf("%d ", (*p).data);
		p = (*p).next;
	}
	printf(")\n");
}
```

Note that the `printForward()` function prints the list's elements from the
first to last. The `printBackward()` function prints the list's elements
from last to first.

```c
void printBackward(struct Node *p) {
	printf("( ");
	while(p != NULL) {
		printf("%d ", (*p).data);
		p = (*p).prev;
	}
	printf(")\n");
}
```

Using all of the code above and calling the two functions:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Node {
	struct Node* prev;
	int data;
	struct Node* next;
};

struct Node* newNode(int newData) {
	struct Node* node = malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
	(*node).prev = NULL;
	(*node).data = newData;
	(*node).next = NULL;
	return node;
}

void printForward(struct Node* p) {
	printf("( ");
	while(p != NULL) {
		printf("%d ", (*p).data);
		p = (*p).next;
	}
	printf(")\n");
}

void printBackward(struct Node *p) {
	printf("( ");
	while(p != NULL) {
		printf("%d ", (*p).data);
		p = (*p).prev;
	}
	printf(")\n");
}

int main() {
	struct Node* root = NULL;
	struct Node* n1 = newNode(1);
	struct Node* n2 = newNode(2);
	struct Node* tailend = newNode(3);

	// linking
	root = n1;
	(*n1).next = n2;
	(*n2).prev = n1;
	(*n2).next = tailend;
	(*tailend).prev = n2;

	printForward(root);
	printBackward(tailend);
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
( 1 2 3 )
( 3 2 1 )
```

Look at that, it works. As we saw with singly linked lists, instantiating
and linking nodes manually is pretty tedious. For the pseudocode in the
rest of this section, we'll use a function called `newDList()` that returns
a pointer to a `DList` struct. The `DList` struct consists of a node
pointer called `head` (a pointer to the first node), and a node pointer
called `foot` (a pointer to the last node). The `newDList()` function
allows us to implement the doubly linked list ${(1,2,3)_d}$ in pseudocode
as:

```rust
DList* dlist = newDList([1,2,3]);
```

Below is an implementation in C.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// The node data structure.
struct Node {
	struct Node* prev; // Pointer to the previous node.
	int data; // The data stored in the node.
	struct Node* next; // Pointer to the next node.
};

// Function: Creates a new node, and returns a pointer to the new node.
struct Node* newNode(int newData) {
	struct Node* node = malloc(sizeof(struct Node)); // Make space for a new node.
	(*node).prev = NULL; // Pointer to previous node is NULL by default
	(*node).data = newData; // store newData in the data field.
	(*node).next = NULL; // Pointer to next node is NULL by default.
	return node;
}

// The doubly-linked list data structure. It consists of two pointers:
struct DList {
	struct Node* head; // Pointer to the first node in the list.
	struct Node* foot; // Pointer to the last node in the list.
};

// Function: Creates a new instance of DList.
// It takes an array and returns a doubly-linked list.
struct DList* newDList(int arr[], int size) {
	struct DList* DList = malloc(sizeof(struct DList)); // Make space for a DList.
	(*DList).head = newNode(arr[0]); // List head points to a node with arr[0] as data.
	(*DList).foot = (*DList).head; // List foot starts at the same place as head.
	for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) { // Loop: start at the second element.
		struct Node* t = newNode(arr[i]); // Create new node storing arr[i] as data.
		(*t).next = (*(*DList).foot).next; // New node's next points to foot's next (NULL by default).
		(*t).prev = (*DList).foot; // New node's prev points to list's foot.
		(*(*DList).foot).next = t; // Foot's next points to the new node.
		(*DList).foot = t; // List's foot points to the new node.
	}
	return DList;
}

// Function: Prints the DList's data from first (head) to last (foot).
void printForward(struct DList* p) {
	struct Node* t = (*p).head;
	printf("( ");
	while (t != NULL) {
		printf("%d ", (*t).data);
		t = (*t).next;
	}
	printf(")\n");
}

// Function: Prints the DList's data from last (foot) to first (head).
void printBackward(struct DList* p) {
	struct Node* t = (*p).foot;
	printf("( ");
	while (t != NULL) {
		printf("%d ", (*t).data);
		t = (*t).prev;
	}
	printf(")\n");
}

int main() {
	int arr[] = {1,2,3};
	int arrSize = 3;
	struct DList* list1 = newDList(arr, arrSize);
	printForward(list1);
	printBackward(list1);
	return 0;
}
```

Now that we can implement doubly-linked lists, we have the ability to move
forward and back. This ability opens up a wide variety of procedures that
would be slower to execute on singly-linked lists or tedious to implement.
Importantly, we can perform all of the procedures we've seen with
singly-linked lists, the only difference being we can now move forward and
back. To see how this changes things, let's consider a few basic
operations.

## Insertion: Doubly-linked Lists

Suppose we had the following linked list:

<DoublyLinkedList data={[6, 9, 1, 5]} />

To insert a new node into this linked list, it's helpful to pretend each
node, and space between each node, has an index, just as we saw with
singly-linked lists, we can pretend each node has an index, and that
there's an index between each node.

Thus, given a doubly-linked list of size ${4,}$ there are ${5}$ possible
positions for insertion. Let's consider insertion before the first node, or
**prepending** a doubly-linked list.

### Prepending

Given the doubly linked list:

<DoublyLinkedList data={[6, 9, 1, 5]} />

Prepending a new node ${N}$ containing data `d` results in:

<DoublyLinkedList data={["d", 6, 9, 1, 5]} />

The procedure:

1. First create a new node, say ${N}$, and assigning a data value for it.
   Say, ${8.}$ Because we're working with doubly-linked lists, there are a
   total of two links to modify. Why two? Because we have a new node,
   ${N}$, with a `prev` pointer ${p}$ and a `next` pointer ${x,}$ both
   initially NULL.

2. At the head of the list is also a node with a `prev` and `next` pointer.
   This node also has the special pointer ${h,}$ which indicates it as the
   head.

3. Once ${N}$ is instantiated, we must have set its `next` pointer to
   ${h}$'s pointee, ${n_1.}$

4. Once we've modified ${N}$'s `next` pointer, we must then have ${h}$'s
   `prev` pointer point to ${N.}$ Because ${N}$ is now the first node in
   the list, we should have the `head` pointer point to it.

The procedure in pseudocode:

```rust
	fn prepend(Node* head) -> void:
		Node* N = new Node(d);
		N->prev = NULL;
		N->next = head;
		head->prev = N;
		head = N;
```

Notice that these are all basic operations. Prepending to a doubly-linked
list is a constant time operationâ€”${O(1).}$

## Appending to a Doubly Linked List

Referring to the same doubly linked list:

<DoublyLinkedList data={[6, 9, 1, 5]} />

Let's say we wanted to insert a new node, ${(N \mid 4)}$ just before the
last node:

<DoublyLinkedList data={[6, 9, 1, 4, 5]} />

Referring to our index diagram, we would be inserting at position ${3.}$

The procedure:

1. Start with a pointer ${q}$ on the head:
2. Then begin moving it. We move once:
3. Then again to reach the node just before the position we want to append
   to.
4. Now we go back to our new node, ${N:}$
5. We set it's `next` pointer to point to the last node, which is the
   `next` pointee of ${q.}$
6. Notice, however, that ${N}$'s `prev pointer` is still NULL. Thus, we
   must modify this pionter to point to `q`.
7. The last node's `prev` pointer is ${n_3,}$ which is ${q}$'s pointee.
   Accordingly, we must have ${n_4}$'s `prev` point to the new node ${N:}$
8. Finally, ${q}$'s pointee still has its `next` pointer pointing to
   ${n_4:}$
9. We must change this so it points to ${N,}$ the new node:

In pseudocode:

```rust
Node* N = new Node(int data);
Node* q = head;
for (int i = 0; i < position-1; i++):
	q = q->next;
N->next = q->next;
N->prev = q;
if (q->next):
	q->next->prev = N;
q->next = N;
```

Notice that last three lines above:

```rust
if (q->next):
	q->next->prev = N;
q->next = N;
```

We include the if-expression because we must handle the special case of
appending to the end of the list. If `q` points to the last node, then it's
`next` pointer is NULL. In that case, we should'nt be trying to assign
`q`'s next pointee's `prev` pointee, since `q` has no next pointee.

With this algorithm, we must iterate over ${n - 1}$ nodes, where ${n}$ is
the position we want to index into. This means that this algorithm has a
time complexity of ${O(n).}$ This is only if we're inserting to a position
other than the head.

## Deletion

Say we had the following doubly-linked list:

<DoublyLinkedList data={[3, 8, 2, 7]} />

Just as we saw with singly-linked lists, there are two cases for deletion:

1. Deleting the head.
2. Deleting any node other than the head.

We consider each in turn.

### Head Deletion

Using the same linked list earlier, say we wanted to delete the head:

<DoublyLinkedList data={[{ val: 3, focus: true }, 8, 2, 7]} />

If we delete the head, then the node immediately after the head should
become the first node:

<DoublyLinkedList data={[3, { val: 8, focus: true }, 2, 7]} />

This is the key fact to keep in mind when deleting the head. So, to start,
we need two pointers, `p` and `h` on the first node:

<DoublyLinkedList data={[{ val: 3, focus: true, ant: "p h" }, 8, 2, 7]} />

Then, we move the head pointer `h` to the next node:

<DoublyLinkedList data={[3, { val: 8, ant: "h" }, 2, 7]} />

Now that we've moved the head, we can simply delete `p`'s pointee:

<DoublyLinkedList
	data={[{ val: 8, ant: "h" }, 2, 7]}
	width={180}
/>

This leaves us with the list:

<DoublyLinkedList
	data={[8, 2, 7]}
	width={180}
/>

While we've successfully deleted the head, notice the new head's `prev`
pointer is still pointing to `n(1)` which is the node we just deleted.
Accordingly, we must change `n(1)`'s `prev` pointer to `NULL`.

Importantly, when we change `n(2)`'s `prev` pointee, we must take care to
check that `h` actually points to some node. If we deleted the head of a
doubly-linked list with only one node, then `h` would become the null
pointer.

The implementation:

```rust
fn deletedHead(node* head) -> void:
	p = head;
	head = head->next;
	delete p;
	if (head != NULL):
		head->prev = NULL;
```

The procedure above consists of constant steps. As such, this operation
takes constant timeâ€”${O(1).}$ Needless to say, deleting a doubly-linked
list's head is an efficient operation. Contrast this with deleting a node
at a given index, explored in the next section.

### Tail Node Deletion

We have the following doubly-linked list, and we want to delete the fourth
node:

<DoublyLinkedList data={[3, 8, 2, { val: 7, focus: true }, 6]} />

To delete the fourth node, we must have the third node, `n(3)` point to the
fifth node, `n(5)`, annd the fifth node should point on the third node.

However, before we change these pointers' pointees, we must ensure we have
a pointer to the delete target. If we changed the pointees before doing so,
we would no longer have a way to access the delete target.

Hence, we need a pointer `p` on the target node. So, we start by
initializing a pointer `p` initially at the head of the list:

<DoublyLinkedList
	data={[{ val: 3, ant: "p" }, 8, 2, { val: 7, focus: true }, 6]}
/>

Then, with a for-loop, move `p` to delete target:

<DoublyLinkedList data={[3, 8, 2, { val: 7, ant: "p" }, 6]} />

Once `p` is in place, all we have to do is modify `n(3)` and `n(5)`'s
pointees through `p`. With `n(3)`'s `next` pointer pointing to `n(5)` we
want to have `n(5)`'s `prev` pointer pointing to `n(3)`.

Implementing:

```rust
fn delete(Node* head, int position):
	Node* p = head;
	for (int i = 0; i < position - 1; i++):
		p = p->next;
	p->prev->next = p->next;
	if (p->next):
		p->next->prev = p->prev;
	delete p;
```
