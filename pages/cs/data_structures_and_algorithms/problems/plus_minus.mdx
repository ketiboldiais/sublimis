# Plus-minus

Given an array of integers, calculate the ratio of its elements that are:

1. positive,
2. negative, and
3. zero

Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line 6 places after the
decimal.

For example, given:

$$
	arr = [1,1,0,-1,-1]
$$

there are ${n = 5}$ elements. Two elements are positive, two elements are
negative, and on is zero. Their ration are:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		\Z^{+} = \dfrac{2}{5} = 0.400000 \\[1em]
		\Z^{-} = \dfrac{2}{5} = 0.400000 \\[1em]
		zero = \dfrac{1}{5} = 0.200000
	\end{aligned}
$$

The results should thus be printed as:

```rust
0.400000
0.400000
0.200000
```

## Solution

One way to solve this problem is to iterate through the input array,
checking for three conditions:

1. Whether the current element is greater than 0,
2. Whether the current element is less than 0,
3. Whether the current element is equal to 0,

For each of these conditions, we keep an accumulator for each condition,
keeping track of the number of times each condition is true.

Here's a JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
const integerRatios = (arr) => {
	let positiveIntegerCount = 0;
	let negativeIntegerCount = 0;
	let totalElements = arr.length;
	let zeroCount = 0;

	for (let i = 0; i < totalElements; i++) {
		if (arr[i] < 0) negativeIntegerCount++;
		else if (arr[i] === 0) zeroCount++;
		else if (arr[i] > 0) positiveIntegerCount++;
		else continue;
	}

	let positiveIntegerRatio = positiveIntegerCount / totalElements;
	let negativeIntegerRatio = negativeIntegerCount / totalElements;
	let zeroRatio = zeroCount / totalElements;
	let results = [
		positiveIntegerRatio, 
		negativeIntegerRatio, 
		zeroRatio
	];

	for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
		console.log(results[i].toFixed(6));
	}
}

const arr1 = [1,1,0,-1,-1];
const result = integerRatios(arr1);
```
