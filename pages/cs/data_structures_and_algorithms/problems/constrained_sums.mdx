# Constrained Sums

Given five positive integers, find the mimum and maximum values that can be
calculated by:

- Summing exactly four of the five integers.

Print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two
space-separated long integers.

## Example

Suppose the array is:

$$
	arr = [1,3,5,7,9]
$$

The minimum sum is:

$$
	1+3+5+7 = 16
$$

and maximum sum is:

$$
	3+5+7+9 = 24
$$

The function should print:

```rust
16 24
```

## Solution

There are several ways to go about this problem. First, note that the array
always consists of positive integers. We know that addition of the positive
integers is commutative. In other words, adding:

$$
	1 + 2 + 3
$$

is the same as adding

$$
	3 + 1 + 2
$$

Thus, given five positive integers, one approach we can take is summing
everything except the first element, summing everything except the second,
except the third, except the fourth, and except the fifth. Then we return
the smallest of these results as the minimum sum, and the largest of these
results as the maximum sum.

Here's an implementation in JavaScript. This approach uses two for-loops, yielding a time complexity of ${O(n)}$.

```javascript
const minMax = (arr) => {
	const length = 5;
	let max = 0;
	let totalSum = 0;
	let reducedSum = 0;
	for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
		totalSum += arr[i];
	}
	let min = totalSum;
	for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
		reducedSum = totalSum - arr[i];
		if (reducedSum > max) {
			max = reducedSum;
		}
		if (reducedSum < min) {
			min = reducedSum;
		}
		reducedSum = totalSum;
	}
	console.log(`${min} ${max}`)
}

const arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
minMax(arr);

```
```bash
10 14
```
