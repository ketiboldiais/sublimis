# The Queue

In this section, we discuss the **queue** data structure. Like the stack,
the queue is a logical data structure premised on an foundational operating
principle—**first-in-first-out (FIFO)**. For example, in the diagram below,
suppose `A` enters first, then `B`, then `C`, then `D`:

<Queue data={["A", "B", "C", "D"]} />

The first to exit is `A`. The second is `B`. The third is `C`. And the
fourth is `D`. We call the entities in a queue—e.g., `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`
above—**queuers** or **elements**. The name _queue_ is fitting—it's like
standing in a line at the bank, waiting for the next available teller.

The queue has two special positions, the **front** (denoted below as `f`),
and the **rear** (denoted below as `r`).

<Queue data={[{ val: "A", ant: "f" }, "B", "C", { val: "D", ant: "r" }]} />

Consistent with a queue in real life, to delete a queuer from the queue, we
remove the element currently occupying the _front_:

<Queue
	data={[
		{ val: "A", ant: "f", focus: "red" },
		"B",
		"C",
		{ val: "D", ant: "r" },
	]}
/>

And to insert a queuer into the queue, we append an element to the _rear_:

<Queue
	data={[
		{ val: "A", ant: "f" },
		"B",
		"C",
		{ val: "D", ant: "r", focus: "red" },
	]}
/>

By convention, inserting a queuer is called **enqueue**, and removing a
queuer is called **dequeue**.

## Implementations

Like we saw with the stack, there are two kinds of queues: the **bounded
queue**, implemented with a _static array_, and the **unbounded queue**,
implemented with a _linked list_. We consider each below.

For both bounded queues and unbounded queues, we want the following
properties and operations:

- A `length` property, representing the current number of queuers in the
  queue.

- An `isEmpty()` operation, returning `true` if the queue contains no
  queuers and `false` if it does.

- An `enqueue()` operation, for inserting a queuer.

- A `dequeue()` operation, for removing a queuer.

- A `peek()` operation, for retrieving the value a queuer holds.

## RP Bounded Queue

Implementing the bounded queue with an array is simple. Below is a queue
and its array implementation.

<Queue data={[2, 3, 7, 5]} />

<Sequence data={[2, 3, 7, 5]} />

With the static queue, we implement all of the properties mentioned in the
preceding section, with two additional properties and operations:

- A `capacity` property, representing the maximum number of queuers the
  queue can hold.

- A `availableSpace()` operation, which returns how much available space
  there is in the queue.

- An `isFull()` operation, returning `true` if the queue's capacity has
  been reached; otherwise `false`.

To implement the properties and operations above, we must first answer the
following question:

> Do we want one pointer for the queue's rear, or two pointers, one for the
> front and one for the rear?

Generally, with bounded queues, we want two pointers. But, there may be
situations where a single pointer to the rear suffices. For conciseness, we
call the single pointer implementation the **rear-pointed (RP) queue**, and
the two pointer approach the **front-rear-pointed (FRP) queue**. We
consider both in tandem.

For both the RP approach and the FRP approach, an implementation in C can
be done with a `struct`. Below is the RP implementation.

```c
struct Queue {
	int capacity;
	int length;
	int rear;
	int* Q;
}
```

Above, we see the properties examined earlier. The `int` pointer `Q` is a
pointer to an array in the heap, which is the data structure implementing
the bounded queue.

## Constructor

Below is a the RP bounded approach's implementation in C:

```c
struct Queue* newQueue(int maxSize) {
	struct Queue* queue = malloc(sizeof(struct Queue));
	(*queue).capacity = maxSize;
	(*queue).length = 0;
	(*queue).rear = -1;
	(*queue).Q = malloc(sizeof(int) * maxSize);
	return queue;
}
```

This is not that different from what we saw with stacks. With the
constructor in place, we can now consider the various properties and
methods.

## Destructor

For languages without automatic memory management like C and C++, we'll
also want a destructor:

```c
void freeQueue(struct Queue** queue) {
	free((*(*queue)).Q);
	free(*queue);
	*queue = NULL;
}
```

## Capacity Guard

Because the bounded queue has maximum number of queuers it can store, we
need a capacity guard for the other operations to use. Using the C code as
a base for our pseudocode examples, a capacity guard might look like the
following:

```rust
fn isFull(Queue* queue) -> bool:
	return (*queue).length == (*queue).capacity;
```

The implementation relies on the queue's properties `length` and capacity.
If the queue's length equals its capacity, the queue has reached its limit,
and we can't enqueue any further.

Here's an implementation in C. Note that this relies on the `stdbool.h`
header file.

```c
bool isFull(struct Queue* queue) {
	return (*queue).height == (*queue).capacity;
}
```

## Empty Guard

Alongside the capacity guard, we also want an _empty guard_. This allows us
ensure we aren't dequeuing an empty queue:

```rust
fn isEmpty(Queue* queue) -> bool:
	return (*queue).length == 0;
```

Like the capacity guard, the empty guard relies on the queue's `length`
property to determine if the queue is empty. If the queue's length is
${0,}$ then we know that the queue is empty and we should be trying to
perform operations like dequeuing.

Here's an implementation in C. Again, this relies on the `stdbool.h` header
file. Of course, we can just return `0` for false and `1` for true. We use
the `stdbool.h` header file purely for readability and semantics.

```c
bool isEmpty(struct Queue* queue) {
	return (*queue).height == 0;
}
```

## Space Count

This isn't a necessary operation for bounded queues, but it's a
nice-to-have. The `availableSpace()` operation returns how many spots in
the queue we have left for use:

```rust
fn spaceAvailable(Queue* queue) -> int:
	return (*queue).capacity - (*queue).height;
```

The procedure is simple: Compute the difference between the queue's
capacity and the current height.

With these basic operations and properties implemented, we can now consider
the core operations for the bounded queue, `enqueue()` and dequeue().

Here's an implementation in C. Not all that different from the pseudocode:

```c
int availableSpace(struct Queue* queue) {
	return (*queue).capacity - (*queue).height;
}
```

### Enqueuing an RP Bounded Queue

To enqueue with the bounded queue, we must first have a pointer `r`,
corresponding to the queue's rear. Initially, `r = -1`. To insert a new
element into the queue— enqueue—we move `r` to the next location (i.e.,
increment `r`).

For example, suppose we had a static queue of size 5:

<Queue data={["", "", "", "", ""]} />

<Sequence data={["", "", "", "", ""]} />

We begin by moving the pointer `r` to the first index in the array:

<Queue data={["", "", "", "", ""]} />

<Sequence data={[{ val: "", ant: "r" }, "", "", "", ""]} />

Then, we insert the relevant data, say `2`:

<Queue data={[2, "", "", "", ""]} />

<Sequence data={[{ val: 2, ant: "r" }, "", "", "", ""]} />

If we want to add another element, we just increment `r` and continue. In
pseudocode:

```rust
fn enqueue(Queue* queue) -> void:
	if (isFull(queue)):
		printf("Enqueue prohibited: Queue is full.")
	else:
		(*queue).rear++;
		(*queue).Q[ (*queue).rear ] = data;
		(*queue).height++;
```

The enqueue procedure is the same for both the RP bounded queue and FRP
bounded queue. We just need to increment the `rear` pointer, assign the
data, and increment the `height` property.

Below is an implementation in C:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

struct Queue {
	int capacity;
	int height;
	int rear;
	int* Q;
};
struct Queue* newQueue(int maxSize) {
	struct Queue* queue = malloc(sizeof(struct Queue));
	(*queue).capacity = maxSize;
	(*queue).height = 0;
	(*queue).rear = -1;
	(*queue).Q = malloc(sizeof(int) * maxSize);
	return queue;
}
bool isFull(struct Queue* queue) {
	return (*queue).height == (*queue).capacity;
}
bool isEmpty(struct Queue* queue) {
	return (*queue).height == 0;
}
int availableSpace(struct Queue* queue) {
	return (*queue).capacity - (*queue).height;
}

void enqueue(struct Queue* queue, int data) {
	if (isFull(queue)) {
		printf("Enqueue prohibitied: Queue is full.\n");
	} else {
		(*queue).rear++;
		(*queue).Q[(*queue).rear] = data;
		(*queue).height++;
	}
}
```

## Rush-in

As an aside, a useful operation to have with queues is the **rush-in**.
Essentially, enqueuing multiple elements into the queue with a loop:

```rust
fn rushIn(Queue* queue, int array[], int arraySize):
	if (arraySize > availableSpace(queue)):
		print "Insufficient space to rush into queue.";
	else if (arraySize < 0):
		print "Invalid array size: Negative number.";
	else:
		for (int i = 0; i < arraySize; i++):
			enqueue(queue, array[i])
```

This is where the `availableSpace()` operation comes in handy. If the size
passed as an argument is greater than the amount of available space, no
enqueuing is performed.

Below is an implementation in C:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

struct Queue {
	int capacity;
	int height;
	int rear;
	int* Q;
};
struct Queue* newQueue(int maxSize) {
	struct Queue* queue = malloc(sizeof(struct Queue));
	(*queue).capacity = maxSize;
	(*queue).height = 0;
	(*queue).rear = -1;
	(*queue).Q = malloc(sizeof(int) * maxSize);
	return queue;
}
bool isFull(struct Queue* queue) {
	return (*queue).height == (*queue).capacity;
}
bool isEmpty(struct Queue* queue) {
	return (*queue).height == 0;
}
int availableSpace(struct Queue* queue) {
	return (*queue).capacity - (*queue).height;
}
void enqueue(struct Queue* queue, int data) {
	if (isFull(queue)) {
		printf("Enqueue prohibitied: Queue is full.\n");
	} else {
		(*queue).rear++;
		(*queue).Q[(*queue).rear] = data;
		(*queue).height++;
	}
}
void rushIn(struct Queue* queue, int dataArray[], int dataArraySize) {
	if (dataArraySize > availableSpace(queue)) {
		printf("Insufficient space to rush into queue.\n");
	}
	else if (dataArraySize < 0) {
		printf("Invalid array size: Negative number.\n");
	}
	else {
		for (int i = 0; i < dataArraySize; i++) {
			enqueue(queue, dataArray[i]);
		}
	}
}
```

### Dequeuing an RP Bounded Queue

Where the RP and FRP approaches differ is with the `dequeue()` operation.
With just a single pointer to rear —the RP approach—we must _left shift_
the array's elements. This is because dequeuing with an array
implementation effectively means removing the element at index ${0.}$ If
performed no left shift, then we'd have a gap in the array, we and we do
not want that. The RP implementation is thus:

```rust
fn dequeue(Queue* queue) -> void:
	if (isEmpty(queue)):
		println "Nothing to dequeue: Queue is empty.";
	else:
		for (int i = 0; i < (*queue).height; i++):
			(*queue).Q[i] = (*queue).Q[i+1];
		(*queue).rear--;
```

With the RP approach, dequeuing requires iterating over the array, shifting
the elements to the left. This takes ${O(n)}$ time. For such a simple data
structure like the queue, this is generally not desired. For most
applications, we instead want the FRP approach: have two pointers, one for
`front` and the other for `rear`.

Here's an implementation of the `dequeue()` function for an RP bounded
queue:

```c
void dequeue(struct Queue* queue) {
	if (isEmpty(queue)) {
		printf("Nothing to dequeue: Queue is empty.\n");
	} else {
		for (int i = 0; i < (*queue).height; i++) {
			(*queue).Q[i] = (*queue).Q[i+1];
		}
		(*queue).rear--;
		(*queue).height--;
	}
}
```

Testing this function:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
struct Queue {
	int capacity;
	int height;
	int rear;
	int* Q;
};
struct Queue* newQueue(int maxSize) {
	struct Queue* queue = malloc(sizeof(struct Queue));
	(*queue).capacity = maxSize;
	(*queue).height = 0;
	(*queue).rear = -1;
	(*queue).Q = malloc(sizeof(int) * maxSize);
	return queue;
}
bool isFull(struct Queue* queue) {
	return (*queue).height == (*queue).capacity;
}
bool isEmpty(struct Queue* queue) {
	return (*queue).height == 0;
}
int availableSpace(struct Queue* queue) {
	return (*queue).capacity - (*queue).height;
}
void enqueue(struct Queue* queue, int data) {
	if (isFull(queue)) {
		printf("Enqueue prohibitied: Queue is full.\n");
	} else {
		(*queue).rear++;
		(*queue).Q[(*queue).rear] = data;
		(*queue).height++;
	}
}
void dequeue(struct Queue* queue) {
	if (isEmpty(queue)) {
		printf("Nothing to dequeue: Queue is empty.\n");
	} else {
		for (int i = 0; i < (*queue).height; i++) {
			(*queue).Q[i] = (*queue).Q[i+1];
		}
		(*queue).rear--;
		(*queue).height--;
	}
}
void rushIn(struct Queue* queue, int dataArray[], int dataArraySize) {
	if (dataArraySize > availableSpace(queue)) {
		printf("Insufficient space to rush into queue.\n");
	}
	else if (dataArraySize < 0) {
		printf("Invalid array size: Negative number.\n");
	}
	else {
		for (int i = 0; i < dataArraySize; i++) {
			enqueue(queue, dataArray[i]);
		}
	}
}
void printQueue(struct Queue* queue) {
	struct Queue* p = queue;
	if (isEmpty(queue)) {
		printf("Empty queue.\n");
	} else {
		printf("|");
		for (int i = 0; i < (*queue).height; i++) {
			printf(" %d |", (*p).Q[i]);
		}
		printf("\n");
	}
}
int main() {
	const int size = 3;
	int arr[] = {1,2,3};
	struct Queue* queue = newQueue(size);
	rushIn(queue, arr, 3);
	printQueue(queue);
	dequeue(queue);
	printQueue(queue);
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 2 | 3 |
```

## Single-use FRP Bounded Queue

With the FRP bounded queue, we have two pointers, `rear` and `front`:

```rust
struct Queue:
	int capacity;
	int length;
	int rear;
	int front;
	{T}* Q;
	Queue(int size):
		capacity = size;
		length = 0;
		rear = -1;
		front = -1;
		Q = allocate(sizeof({T}) * size)
```

To see why two pointers is useful, let's consider an example. Suppose we
had the following queue, alongside its array implementation:

<Queue data={[1, 8, 2, { val: 5, ant: "r" }]} />

<Sequence data={[1, 8, 2, { val: 5, ant: "r" }]} />

There are two pointers, `r` (the `rear`) and `f` (the `front`). The pointer
`f` is not displayed because initially, `f = -1`. Now let's say the first
queuer is dequeued:

<Queue data={[{ val: "", focus: "red" }, 8, 2, { val: 5, ant: "r" }]} />

<Sequence data={[{ val: "", focus: "red" }, 8, 2, { val: 5, ant: "r" }]} />

As we saw with the RP queue, dequeuing results in an empty space at the
front of the queue. And with the RP queue, the remedy for this is to shift
all of the elements to the left, filling the newly emptied position, much
like how people in a line shift forward.

With people, this is not that big of a deal. A small step forward
miniscule. For computers, however, having so many queuers perform an
operation is inefficient. Is there a more efficient way to do this? It
turns out yes. Instead of having everyone in line at the bank shift towards
the teller, just have the teller shift towards the next customer:

<Queue
	data={[{ val: "", focus: "red", ant: "f" }, 8, 2, { val: 5, ant: "r" }]}
/>

<Sequence
	data={[{ val: "", focus: "red", ant: "f" }, 8, 2, { val: 5, ant: "r" }]}
/>

Examining the diagram, we see that the `f` queuer will always be `Q[f+1]`.
For example, say we start with an empty queue of capacity ${4:}$

<Queue data={["", "", "", ""]} />

<Sequence data={["", "", "", ""]} />

Now say we rush-in two queuers, ${5}$ and ${8:}$

<Sequence data={[5, { val: 8, ant: "r" }, "", ""]} />

<Queue data={[5, { val: 8, ant: "r" }, "", ""]} />

At no point in the rush-in do we increment `f`, which is initially
`f = -1`. The pointer `f` is incremented only if we dequeue. As such, the
front element is still `Q[f+1]`, which in this case, is `Q[0]`.

When we dequeue, `f` increments:

<Sequence data={[{ val: 1, ant: "f" }, { val: "", ant: "r" }, ""]} />

<Queue data={[{ val: 1, ant: "f" }, { val: "", ant: "r" }, ""]} />

When we enqueue say, the new queuers ${2}$ and ${9,}$ we get:

<Sequence data={[{ val: 1, ant: "f" }, 8, 2, { val: 9, ant: "r" }]} />

<Queue data={[{ val: 1, ant: "f" }, 8, 2, { val: 9, ant: "r" }]} />

Implementing the `dequeue()` procedure:

```rust
fn dequeue(Queue* queue) -> void:
	if (isEmpty(queue)):
		println "Nothing to dequeue: Queue is empty.";
	else:
		(*queue).front++;
		(*queue).height--;
```

Examining the procedure above, we see that the algorithm consists entirely
of basic steps—${O(1)}$ time. Compare this with the RP bounded queue, where
it took ${O(n)}$ time to dequeue elements.

At this point, we might have a lot of questions. How does this impact all
of the other operations? What about the gaps? Didn't the RP bounded queue
employ a left-shift in the first place because of gaps in the array
implementation? These are all fair questions, and we address them carefully
in turn.

## Empty Guard

The first question we should address is the empty guard; answers to the
other questions will build on the answer to this first question. What
condition should we test for when the FRP bounded queue is empty? Well,
let's consider an example.

Suppose we have the following queue and its array implementation:

<Sequence data={[{ val: 1, ant: "f" }, 3, 2, { val: 7, ant: "r" }]} />

<Queue data={[{ val: 1, ant: "f" }, 3, 2, { val: 7, ant: "r" }]} />

```rust
f = 0;
r = 3
```

As we can see, we've already dequeued once. If we dequeue again:

<Sequence
	data={[
		{ val: "", focus: "red" },
		{ val: 3, focus: "red", ant: "f" },
		2,
		{ val: 7, ant: "r" },
	]}
/>

<Queue
	data={[
		{ val: "", focus: "red" },
		{ val: 3, focus: "red", ant: "f" },
		2,
		{ val: 7, ant: "r" },
	]}
/>

```rust
f = 1;
r = 3
```

And again:

<Sequence
	data={[
		{ val: "", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "", focus: "red" },
		{ val: 2, focus: "red", ant: "f" },
		{ val: 7, ant: "r" },
	]}
/>

<Queue
	data={[
		{ val: "", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "", focus: "red" },
		{ val: 2, focus: "red", ant: "f" },
		{ val: 7, ant: "r" },
	]}
/>

```rust
f = 2;
r = 3
```

And dequeuing one more time:

<Sequence
	data={[
		{ val: "", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "", focus: "red" },
		{ val: 2, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 7, focus: "red", ant: "f r" },
	]}
/>

<Queue
	data={[
		{ val: "", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "", focus: "red" },
		{ val: 2, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 7, focus: "red", ant: "f r" },
	]}
/>

```rust
f = 3;
r = 3
```

Then, dequeuing one last time:

<Sequence
	data={[
		{ val: "", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "", focus: "red" },
		{ val: 2, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 7, focus: "red", ant: "r" },
	]}
/>

<Queue
	data={[
		{ val: "", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "", focus: "red" },
		{ val: 2, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 7, focus: "red", ant: "r" },
	]}
/>

```rust
fn isEmpty(*Queue queue) -> bool:
	return (*queue).front == (*queue).rear;
```

Note that this is all a matter of interpretation. In a language like C, the
data is more than likely still inside the array. But even if it was, it's
essentially lost, because the only way we can interact with the queue is
through the front and rear pointers.

## Capacity Guard

For the capacity guard, we will use the following function:

```rust
fn isFull(*Queue queue) -> bool:
	return (*queue).r == capacity - 1;
```

This corresponds to the fact that if `rear` equals the last index in the
array, we've reached capacity.

## Enqueue

For enqueuing a queuer, we use the following procedure:

```rust
fn enqueue(Queue* queue, {T} data):
	if (isFull(*queue)):
		print "Queue is full"
	else:
		(*queue).rear++;
		(*queue).Q[(*queue).rear] = data;
```

Examining this procedure, we see that the dequeue procedure runs in
constant time—${O(1).}$

## Dequeue

For dequeuing a queuer, we use the following procedure:

```rust
fn dequeue(Queue* queue) -> {T}:
	int x = -1;
	if (isEmpty(*queue)):
		print "Nothing to dequeue; queue is empty."
	else:
		(*queue).front++;
		x = (*queue).Q[(*queue).front];
	return x;
```

Examining this procedure, we see that the dequeue procedure runs in
constant time—${O(1).}$

## Single-use FRP Drawbacks

If we thought about FRPs carefully, we might have noticed a few drawbacks.
Suppose we had the following queue:

<Queue data={[2, 4, 8, 1, { val: 3, ant: "r" }]} />

If we dequeue twice, we get:

<Queue
	data={[
		{ val: "", focus: "red" },
		{ val: 4, focus: "red", ant: "f" },
		8,
		1,
		3,
	]}
/>

Because of the way we've implemented `isFull()` and `isEmpty()`, we cannot
reuse the space previously occupied by the dequeued queuer. If dequeued all
of the elements:

<Queue data={["", "", "", "", { val: "", ant: "r" }]} cname={"all-red"} />

and executed `isEmpty()`, we would get back `true`, since `front > rear`.
Given this restriction, we call such FRPs **single-use FRP-bounded
queues**. While single-use FRPs are useful for certain problems, most
problems would be better served by reusing the freed spaces. To do so, we
must use either: a _Resetting FRP_ or a _circular queue._

## Resetting FRPs

A **multi-use FRP** is an FRP that reuses a dequeued element's newly
available space. The multi-use FRP's implementation is, for the most part,
the same as the single-use FRP, but with **pointer resetting**.

The solution is simple: The moment `isEmpty()` returns `true`,
re-initialize `front` and `rear` to `-1`. For example, consider the
following queue:

<Queue data={[2, 4, 8, 1, { val: 3, ant: "r" }]} />

If we dequeued all of the elements:

<Queue data={["", "", "", "", { val: "", ant: "r" }]} cname={"all-red"} />

we immediately reset the pointers `front` and `rear` to `-1`:

<Queue data={["", "", "", "", ""]} />

This allows us to reuse the dequeued element's spaces. Accordinly,
implementing the resetting FRP is just a matter of writing a new function
called `reset`:

```rust
fn reset(Queue* queue) -> void:
	if (isEmpty(*queue)):
		(*queue).front = -1;
		(*queue).rear = -1;
	else:
		print "Cannot reset; queue is not empty."
```

The problem, however, is that there's a catch: We can only reuse the
dequeued spaces only if the array is empty. This means that in the
situation:

<Queue
	data={[
		{ val: "", focus: "red" },
		{ val: 4, focus: "red" },
		8,
		1,
		{ val: "r", ant: "r" },
	]}
/>

We cannot use the dequeued space, because the queue is not empty. Because
of this limitation, we want to a **circular queue**.

## Circular Queues

Circular queues are the solution to the problems posed by single-use FRPs
and resetting FRPs. First, instead of starting `front` and `rear` at `-1`,
we start them at `0`. For example, suppose we had a queue with a capacity
of ${6:}$

<Queue data={[{ val: 0, ant: "f r" }, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]} />

Say we enqueue the value `1`. So the rear pointer `r` increments, and
initializes the value `1` at index ${1:}$

<Queue
	data={[{ val: "", ant: "f" }, { val: 1, ant: "r" }, "", "", "", ""]}
/>

The index that `f` points to, ${0}$ in this case, must be left empty.
Wherever `f` is pointing, that location must be left empty. Let's say we
filled the rest of queue spaces:

<Queue
	data={[{ val: "", ant: "f" }, 1, 5, 8, 9, 3, { val: 3, ant: "r" }]}
/>

Now let's say we dequeue two queuers:

<Queue
	data={[
		{ val: "", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "", focus: "red", ant: "f" },
		8,
		9,
		{ val: 3, ant: "r" },
	]}
/>

and we want to enqueue the element `2`. For single-use FRPs and resetting
FRPs, we saw that we cannot enqueue here. For circular queues, however, we
definitely can: Move `r` back to `0`, and enqueue:

<Queue
	data={[
		{ val: 2, ant: "r" },
		{ val: "", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "", focus: "red", ant: "f" },
		8,
		9,
		3,
	]}
/>

At this point, the queue is _full_. Remember, we cannot use the space `f`
points to. If we allow `r` to point at this space, then both `f` and `r`
are equal. And if both `f` and `r` are equal, then the queue is empty.

To insert the element `7`, we simply increment `r` and enqueue:

<Queue
	data={[
		2,
		{ val: 7, ant: "r" },
		{ val: "", ant: "f", focus: "red" },
		8,
		9,
		3,
	]}
/>

Let's consider another example, this time visualizing the circular queue.
We visualize the circular queue

<Queue
	data={[
		2,
		{ val: 7, ant: "r" },
		{ val: "", ant: "f", focus: "red" },
		8,
		9,
		3,
	]}
/>

as:

<CircularQueue
	data={[2, { val: 7, ant: "r" }, { val: "", ant: "f" }, 8, 9, 3]}
/>

Thinking of the circular queue in this way, it's more apparent what we have
to do to bring `r` back to the first index ${0}$ once it's reached the last
index—through the modulus operator. Consider the table of values, where
${r}$ is the value of `rear`, and `s` is the circular queue's capacity:

| ${r}$ | ${(r + 1) \bmod s}$ |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| ${0}$ | ${1 \bmod 5 = 1}$   |
| ${1}$ | ${2 \bmod 5 = 2}$   |
| ${2}$ | ${3 \bmod 5 = 3}$   |
| ${3}$ | ${4 \bmod 5 = 4}$   |
| ${4}$ | ${5 \bmod 5 = 0}$   |
| ${0}$ | ${1 \bmod 5 = 1}$   |
| ${1}$ | ${2 \bmod 5 = 2}$   |
| ${2}$ | ${3 \bmod 5 = 3}$   |
| ${3}$ | ${4 \bmod 5 = 4}$   |
| ${4}$ | ${5 \bmod 5 = 0}$   |

Notice how we're going back to ${0}$ once we've reached the inex ${4.}$
This is precisely what we want.

### Circular Queue: Capacity Guard

Following our previous analysis, the circular queue's capacity guard is
implemented as such:

```rust
fn isFull(Queue* q) -> bool:
	rear = (*q).rear + 1;
	front = (*q).front;
	max = (*q).capacity;
	return rear % max == front;
```

Examining this procedure, we see that `isFull()` takes ${O(1)}$ time to
execute.

### Circular Queue: Empty Guard

The empty guard is no different from the FRP's empty guard:

```rust
fn isEmpty(Queue* q) -> bool:
	return (*queue).front == (*queue).rear;
```

Needless to say, this function takes ${O(1)}$ time to execute.

### Circular Queue: Enqueue

To enqueue into a circular queue, we use the following:

```rust
fn enqueue(Queue* queue, {T} data) -> void:
	if isFull(*queue):
		print "Queue is full, enqueue prohibited."
	else:
		(*queue).rear = ((*queue).rear + 1) % (*queue).size;
		(*queue).Q[(*queue).rear] = data;
```

Again, this procedure has a time complexity of ${O(1).}$ Thus, the circular
queue's `enqueue()` procedure runs in constant time.

### Circular Queue: Dequeue

The circular queue's dequeue operation appears as such:

```rust
fn dequeue(Queue* queue) -> {T}:
	{T} data = NULL;
	if (isEmpty(queue)):
		printf "Queue is empty, dequeue prohibited."
	else:
		(*queue).front = ((*queue).front + 1) % (*queue).size;
		data = (*queue).Q[(*queue).front];
	return data;
```

This procedure has a time complexity of ${O(1)}$—constant time.

## Linked List Queues

Queues implemented with linked lists are called **linked queues**. Recall
that the queue is a first-in-first-out data structure. As such, we must
account for this characteristic when implementing a linked queue.

Consider the following queue:

<Queue data={[{ val: 2, ant: "f" }, 8, 9, { val: 3, ant: "r" }]} />

Implementing this as a linked list, we have:

<LinkedList data={[{ val: 2, ant: "f" }, 8, 9, { val: 3, ant: "r" }]} />

Initially, the front pointer `f` and the rear pointer `r` should be `NULL`.
Thus, when we create the first node for the queue above, we create the node
with a pointer `t`, then have the pointers `f` and `r` point to this new
node:

<LinkedList data={[{ val: 2, ant: "t f r" }]} />

Once we have the first node established, we can begin queuing and
dequeuing.

## Empty Guard

For the linked list queue, the empty guard is as follows:

```rust
fn isEmpty(*Queue queue) -> bool:
	return (*queue).front == NULL;
```

Notice that we're simply testing if `front` is `NULL`. If it is, then we
can conclude that the queue is empty.

## Capacity Guard

The capacity guard looks like:

```rust
fn isFull(Node* n) -> bool:
	return n == NULL;
```

Notice that we're testing if a particular node pointer is the null pointer.
We do so because with linked lists, we can dequeue and enqueue (nodes) as
much as we want, so long as the pointer returned from allocating space is
not null. If it is null, then we've run out of heap memory—i.e., the queue
is full.

### Enqueue

The enqueue procedure:

```rust
fn enqueue(Queue* queue, {T} data) -> void:
	Node *t = new Node;
	if (isFull(t)):
		print "Queue is full."
	else:
		(*t).data = data;
		if ((*queue).front == NULL):
			(*queue).front = rear = t;
		else:
			(*queue).rear->next = t;
			(*queue).rear = t;
```

### Dequeue

The dequeue procedure appears as follows:

```rust
{T} dequeue(struct Queue* queue):
	{T} datum = MIN_INT;
	Node* p;
		if (isEmpty(queue)):
			print "Nothing to dequeue; returning MIN_INT";
		else:
			p = (*queue).front
			(*queue).front = (*(*queue).front).next;
			datum = (*p).data;
			free(p);
	return datum;
```

In this implementation, we return the data bound to the dequeued queuer.
And as with many of the other procedures, this procedure has a time
complexity of ${O(1)}$—constant time.

## Deque

The **double-ended queue** (appreviated **deque**, pronounced _deck_), is a
queue where insertion and deletion can be done on both the front- and
rear-ends of the queue.

For FRPs, circular queues, and linked-list queues, we've used both front
and rear pointers. Moreover, to enqueue we've used the rear pointer, and to
dequeue we've used the rear pointer exclusively. I.e., we can only insert
and remove queuers from the front of the queue. For the deque, however, we
can enqueue and dequeue from both ends of the queue.

| **Queue** | insert                       | delete                       |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `front`   | ${\color{indianred} \times}$ | ${\color{green} \checkmark}$ |
| `rear`    | ${\color{green} \checkmark}$ | ${\color{indianred} \times}$ |

| **Deque** | insert                       | delete                       |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `front`   | ${\color{green} \checkmark}$ | ${\color{green} \checkmark}$ |
| `rear`    | ${\color{green} \checkmark}$ | ${\color{green} \checkmark}$ |

Because of this trait, deques are much more like a deck of cards than they
are a line of queuers—it's easy to take one card off either end of the
deck, but harder to extract an individual card from the deck's center.

For example, suppose we had the following deque:

<Queue data={["", "", "", "", ""]} />

Initially, both `f` (the front pointer) and `r` (the rear pointer), are
`-1`. Let's insert the dequer `3` with the rear pointer:

<Queue data={[{ val: 3, ant: "r" }, "", "", "", ""]} />

Let's insert three more dequers:

<Queue data={[3, 5, 7, { val: 9, ant: "r" }, ""]} />

Now let's delete a dequer using the front pointer:

<Queue data={[{ val: "", ant: "f" }, 5, 7, { val: 9, ant: "r" }, ""]} />

Deleting once more with the front pointer:

<Queue data={["", { val: "", ant: "f" }, 7, { val: 9, ant: "r" }, ""]} />

So far, this doesn't look all that different from what we've seen with
queues. So what's the difference? We can insert a new dequer with the front
pointer. We simply use the front pointer to assign the new dequer, followed
by a decrement of the front pointer's value. Say we wanted to insert the
dequer `3`:

<Queue data={[{ val: "", ant: "f" }, 3, 7, { val: 9, ant: "r" }, ""]} />

We can insert once more:

<Queue data={[2, 3, 7, { val: 9, ant: "r" }, ""]} />

At this point, the front pointer `f` is `-1`, and we use that as a
condition indicating that we cannot insert towards the `front` any further.

## Input-restricted Deques

The **input-restricted deque (indeque)** is a deque where insertion can
only be done with the rear, but deletion may be done on both the front- and
rear-ends.

## Output-restricted Deques

The **output-restricted deque (outdeque)** is a deque where deletion can
only be done with the front, but insertion may be done on both the front-
and rear-ends.

## Priority Queues

A **priority queue** is a queue with priority constraints for enqueuing and
dequeuing. There are two ways to implement these priority contraints:

1. Establishing a priority criteria, or
2. assigning priority to particular elements.
