# Traversal Complexities

Let's lay out our numeric conclusions for the traversal approaches:

| preorder()  | ${2N + 1}$ | ${H + 2}$ |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------- |
| inorder()   | ${2N + 1}$ | ${H + 2}$ |
| postorder() | ${2N + 1}$ | ${H + 2}$ |

Where ${N}$ is the tree's order, and ${H}$ is the tree's height.

The number of calls and stack sizes are all the same. Now, recall the
Proper Binary Tree Bounds Lemma: The height of a tree, denoted ${H,}$ has
the bounds:

<figure>$$ O(\log n) ≤ H ≤ O(n) $$</figure>

where ${n}$ is the number of nodes. This yields the following complexities:

<table>
	<thead>
		<th>Traversal Method</th>
		<th>Time Complexity</th>
		<th>Space Complexity</th>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>`preorder()`</td>
			<td>${O(n)}$</td>
			<td>${O(\log n) \leq H \leq O(n)}$</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`inorder()`</td>
			<td>${O(n)}$</td>
			<td>${O(\log n) \leq H \leq O(n)}$</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`postorder()`</td>
			<td>${O(n)}$</td>
			<td>${O(\log n) \leq H \leq O(n)}$</td>
		</tr>
		
	</tbody>
</table>

Where ${n}$ is the tree's order, and ${H}$ is the tree's height.

Thus, traversing an entire binary tree has a time complexity of ${O(n).}$
And the space complexity for such a traversal is at least ${O(\log n),}$
and at most ${O(n),}$ depending on the tree's height.
