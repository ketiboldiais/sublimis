# Comparing Traversal Methods

When working with binary tree data structures, we often want to quickly
sketch in our minds what a particular approach's traversal sequence looks
like. Having this sketch can be a powerful tool for gainign some traction
on solving a problem. Accordingly, let's investigate some techniques for
quickly determining a particular sequence.

First, it's helpful to associate the traversal approaches with a few visit
sequences. For the visit sequences in the table below, `L` stands for
"visit the _left_ subtree," `root` stands for "visit the _root_," and `R`
stands for "visit the _right_ subtree."

| Preorder     | `root L R`                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Inorder      | `L root R`                              |
| Postorder    | `L R root`                              |
| Generational | Generation by generation, left to right |

Knowing these sequences can make traversal sequences for more complicated
trees clearer. For example, consider the following tree:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "a" },
		{ child: "d", parent: "b" },
		{ child: "e", parent: "b" },
		{ child: "f", parent: "c" },
		{ child: "g", parent: "c" },
	]}
/>

Trying to determine the traversal sequence for any given traversal approach
can appear daunting. The trick, however, is _divide and conquer_: Break the
tree down into subtrees. In this case, let's break it down into a
left-subtree (the nodes in red) and a right-subtree (the nodes in blue):

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a", focus: "red" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "a", focus: "blue" },
		{ child: "d", parent: "b", focus: "red" },
		{ child: "e", parent: "b", focus: "red" },
		{ child: "f", parent: "c", focus: "blue" },
		{ child: "g", parent: "c", focus: "blue" },
	]}
/>

Let's first consider preorder traversal. For preorder traversal, we have
`root L R`. So, we write:

$$
	a, (~~~~~)_{\texttt{L}}, (~~~~~)_{\texttt{R}}
$$

Now we fill in the parentheses. First, the left subtree, following the same
sequence, `root L R`:

$$
	a, (b, d, e)_{\texttt{L}}, (~~~~~)_{\texttt{R}}
$$

Then the right subtree, following the same sequence, `root L R`.

$$
	a, (b, d, e)_{\texttt{L}}, (c, f, g)_{\texttt{R}}
$$

Thus, the inorder traversal sequence for the tree is:

$$
	(a, b, d, e, c, f, g)
$$

Using the same method, let's try inorder traversal. For inorder traversal,
the visit sequence is `L root R`. So we write:

$$
	(~~~~~)_{\texttt{L}}, a, (~~~~~)_{\texttt{R}}
$$

Now we fill in the subtree parentheses. Starting with the left subtree, we
use the same sequence, `L root R`:

$$
	(d, b, e)_{\texttt{L}}, a, (~~~~~)_{\texttt{R}}
$$

Then we fill in the right subtree's parentheses, again using `L root R`:

$$
	(d, b, e)_{\texttt{L}}, a, (f, c, g)_{\texttt{R}}
$$

Hence, the inorder traversal sequence is:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "", ant: 1 },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a", focus: "red", ant: 2 },
		{ child: "c", parent: "a", focus: "blue", ant: 5 },
		{ child: "d", parent: "b", focus: "red", ant: 3 },
		{ child: "e", parent: "b", focus: "red", ant: 4 },
		{ child: "f", parent: "c", focus: "blue", ant: 6 },
		{ child: "g", parent: "c", focus: "blue", ant: 7 },
	]}
/>

$$
	(a, b, d, e, c, f, g)
$$

Now let's try postorder traversal. The visit sequence is `L R root`, so we
have:

$$
	(~~~~~)_{\texttt{L}}, (~~~~~)_{\texttt{R}}, a
$$

Now we fill in the subtrees, again using `L R root`. For the left subtree:

$$
	(d, e, b)_{\texttt{L}}, (~~~~~)_{\texttt{R}}, a
$$

And for the right subtree:

$$
	(d, e, b)_{\texttt{L}}, (f, g, c)_{\texttt{R}}, a
$$

This yields the postorder traversal sequence:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "", ant: 4 },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a", focus: "red", ant: 2 },
		{ child: "c", parent: "a", focus: "blue", ant: 6 },
		{ child: "d", parent: "b", focus: "red", ant: 1 },
		{ child: "e", parent: "b", focus: "red", ant: 3 },
		{ child: "f", parent: "c", focus: "blue", ant: 5 },
		{ child: "g", parent: "c", focus: "blue", ant: 7 },
	]}
/>

$$
	(d, e, b, f, g, c, a)
$$

Finally, generational traversal is simple enough that we don't need to
apply some visit sequence. We merely traverse the tree from the first
generation to the last generation, visiting each node from left to right:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "", ant: 1 },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a", focus: "red", ant: 2 },
		{ child: "c", parent: "a", focus: "blue", ant: 3 },
		{ child: "d", parent: "b", focus: "red", ant: 4 },
		{ child: "e", parent: "b", focus: "red", ant: 5 },
		{ child: "f", parent: "c", focus: "blue", ant: 6 },
		{ child: "g", parent: "c", focus: "blue", ant: 7 },
	]}
/>

$$
	(a, b, c, d, e, f, g)
$$
