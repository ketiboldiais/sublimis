# BST Generation via Traversal

Earlier, we saw that we can generate a binary search tree by iteratively
calling the `insert()` function. We can, however, also generate a BST
through preorder-traversal (or postorder-traversal). Moreover, unlike the
previous sections where we saw how we needed an additional
inorder-traversal sequence, we can generate a binary search tree with
preorder- or postorder-traversal alone. Let's start with
preorder-traversal.

We're given the following preorder-traversal sequence:

<Sequence
	data={[
		{ val: 30 },
		{ val: 20 },
		{ val: 10 },
		{ val: 15 },
		{ val: 25 },
		{ val: 40 },
		{ val: 50 },
		{ val: 45 },
	]}
/>

Alongside this array, we also need an auxiliary data structure, a stack:

<Stack data={["", "", ""]} />

With the sequence and the stack, we can begin. We start by focusing on the
first element of the sequence. In this case, `pre[0]=30`. We create a node
and have two pointers point to it, the `root` pointer, and a temporary
pointer `p`:

<Sequence
	data={[
		{ val: 30, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 20 },
		{ val: 10 },
		{ val: 15 },
		{ val: 25 },
		{ val: 40 },
		{ val: 50 },
		{ val: 45 },
	]}
/>

<Tree data={[{ child: "30", parent: "", ant: "p root" }]} />

<Stack data={["", "", ""]} />

Now we focus on the next element, `pre[1]=20`. We make a check:
`pre[0] < 30`. True. Because it's true, we perform the following steps:

1. Create a new node with a temporary pointer `t`.
2. Make `p`'s left-child pointer point to the new node.
3. Push the address of `p`'s pointee into the stack.
4. Move `p` to the newly created node.

Thus, we have:

<Sequence
	data={[
		{ val: 30, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 20, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 10 },
		{ val: 15 },
		{ val: 25 },
		{ val: 40 },
		{ val: 50 },
		{ val: 45 },
	]}
/>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "30", parent: "", pointer: "root" },
		{ child: "20", parent: "30", pointer: "t,p" },
		{ child: "10", parent: "30", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

<Stack data={[{ val: "" }, { val: "" }, { val: "ad(30)" }]} />

Now we move to the next element in the sequence, `pre[2]=10`. We perform
the check again: `pre[2] < 20`. True. Again, we create a new node with a
temporary pointer `t`, make `p`'s left-child pointer to the new node, push
the address of `p`'s pointee into the stack, and move `p` to the newly
created node:

<Sequence
	data={[
		{ val: 30, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 20, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 10, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 15 },
		{ val: 25 },
		{ val: 40 },
		{ val: 50 },
		{ val: 45 },
	]}
/>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "30", parent: "", pointer: "root" },
		{ child: "20", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "a", parent: "30", display: "none" },
		{ child: "10", parent: "20", pointer: "t,p" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "20", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

<Stack data={[{ val: "" }, { val: "ad(20)" }, { val: "ad(30)" }]} />

Move the next element, `pre[3]=15`. Check: `pre[3] < 10`. False. So,
`node(15)` should be the right-child of `node(10)`. But not so fast. We
have to be careful here. Suppose `pre[3]` was `28` instead. If that were
the case, then blindly attaching `node(28)` as the right-child of
`node(10)` would cause a problem &mdash; `28` is greater than `25`, and any
node greater than `25` should be in `node(25)`'s right-subtree, not its
left. Accordingly, we have two possibilities when `node(i) < node(i-1)`
(i.e., when the node we're about to insert has a value less than the node
we just inserted):

1. `node(i-1) < node(i) < stackTop(node)`
2. `node(i-1) < stackTop(node) < node(i)`

The first case is when the node we're about to insert has a value greater
than the node we just inserted, but less than the value of the node at the
stack's topframe. (The node at the stack's topframe is the node we inserted
just before the last node we inserted). If the first case is true, then we
proceed to inserting the new node as the right-child. In this case, it is,
so we perform the following:

1. Create a new node as the pointee of `t.`
2. Make `p`'s right-child point to `t`.
3. Set `p`'s new pointee as `t`.

Importantly, we <em>do not</em> push `p` onto the stack. Why don't we push
`p`? Because if we pushed `p` onto the stack, then the stack's topmost
frame would contain the address of `Node(10)`. But we don't need that
address in there. The stack's sole purpose is to keep track of which nodes
could still have children. The moment we assign a right-child to a node,
there are no other possible children the node can have, because the
sequence we're given is the inorder traversal sequence &mdash; there are no
left-children for a particular node once we've been given its right-child.

That said, performing the above results in:

<Sequence
	data={[
		{ val: 30, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 20, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 10, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 15, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 25 },
		{ val: 40 },
		{ val: 50 },
		{ val: 45 },
	]}
/>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "30", parent: "", pointer: "root" },
		{ child: "20", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "a", parent: "30", display: "none" },
		{ child: "10", parent: "20" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "20", display: "none" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "10", display: "none" },
		{ child: "15", parent: "10", pointer: "t,p" },
	]}
/>

<Stack data={[{ val: "" }, { val: "ad(20)" }, { val: "ad(30)" }]} />

Now we go to the next element &mdash; `pre[4]=25`. Check once more:
`pre[4] < 15`. False. We've hit another false case, so we make the
additional check we saw earlier. Is `pre[4] > (*p).data`? I.e., is
`25 > 15`? Yes. Check the second possibility: Is `pre[4] < stackTop(node)`?
No, `25 &nlt; 20`.

Here, the second case is true. So, we pop the stack, and move `p` to that
address `node(20)`. Then we must compare again: `25 < 20`? False. Once more
we make a check: Is `pre[4] < stackTop(node)`? Yes. `25 < 30.` Now we can
continue the normal course &mdash; attach `node(25)` as the right-child of
`node(20)`, with `p` pointing to the new node:

<Sequence
	data={[
		{ val: 30, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 20, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 10, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 15, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 25, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 40 },
		{ val: 50 },
		{ val: 45 },
	]}
/>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "30", parent: "", pointer: "root" },
		{ child: "20", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "a", parent: "30", display: "none" },
		{ child: "10", parent: "20" },
		{ child: "25", parent: "20", pointer: "t,p" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "10", display: "none" },
		{ child: "15", parent: "10" },
	]}
/>

<Stack data={[{ val: "" }, { val: "" }, { val: "ad(30)" }]} />

Next: `pre[5]=40`. First check: `pre[5] < (*p).data`. False; `40 &nlt; 25.`
Second check: `pre[5] > (*p).data`. True. Third check: Is
`pre[5] < peek(stack)->data` False. So, we have to pop the stack.
`p = pop(stack)`. Now `p` points to `node(30)`, and we go through checks
again. This results in:

<Sequence
	data={[
		{ val: 30, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 20, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 10, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 15, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 25, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 40, focus: "red" },
		{ val: 50 },
		{ val: 45 },
	]}
/>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "30", parent: "", pointer: "root" },
		{ child: "20", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "40", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "10", parent: "20" },
		{ child: "25", parent: "20", pointer: "t,p" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "10", display: "none" },
		{ child: "15", parent: "10" },
	]}
/>

<Stack data={[{ val: "" }, { val: "" }, { val: "" }]} />

The process continues for the remaining elements. The algorithm:

```rust
fn createPre(int pre[], int n):
	Stack _stack = newStack(5);
	Node *t;
	int i = 0;
	root = newNode();
	(*root).data = pre[i];
	i++;
	Node* p = root;
	while (i < n):
		if (pre[i] < (*p).data):
			t = newNode(pre[i++]);
			(*p).left_child = t;
			push(_stack, p);
			p = t;
		else if ((pre[i] > (*p).data) && (pre[i] < peek(stack)->data)):
			t = newNode(pre[i++]);
			(*p).right_child = t;
			p = t;
		else:
			p = pop(stack);
```
