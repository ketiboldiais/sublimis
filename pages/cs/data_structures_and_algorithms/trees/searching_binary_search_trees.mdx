# Searching a Binary Search Tree

Searching through a binary search tree is very simple. Consider the
following tree:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "30", parent: "" },
		{ child: "15", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "50", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "10", parent: "15" },
		{ child: "20", parent: "15" },
		{ child: "40", parent: "50" },
		{ child: "60", parent: "50" },
	]}
/>

Suppose we wanted to find the element `40`. First, we take a pointer and
start at the root:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "30", parent: "", ant: "p", focus: "red" },
		{ child: "15", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "50", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "10", parent: "15" },
		{ child: "20", parent: "15" },
		{ child: "40", parent: "50" },
		{ child: "60", parent: "50" },
	]}
/>

With the pointer `p` set, we read `p`'s pointee's value, and compare it
against the key. In this case, we see that `40 &nlt; 30`, so we move `p` to
the current pointee's right-child:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "30", parent: "" },
		{ child: "15", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "50", parent: "30", ant: "p", focus: "red" },
		{ child: "10", parent: "15" },
		{ child: "20", parent: "15" },
		{ child: "40", parent: "50" },
		{ child: "60", parent: "50" },
	]}
/>

Given `p`'s new pointee, we perform the procedure again. The comparison
returns `40 < 50`, so we move `p` to the current pointee's left-child:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "30", parent: "" },
		{ child: "15", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "50", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "10", parent: "15" },
		{ child: "20", parent: "15" },
		{ child: "40", parent: "50", ant: "p", focus: "red" },
		{ child: "60", parent: "50" },
	]}
/>

Comparing the pointee's value to our key, we see that `40 = 40`, and the
search concludes &mdash; we've found our match. What if the key were
instead `39`? In that case, we would get to the node labeled `40` above,
then set `p` to node `40`'s left-child. But, because there is no such node,
`p` is set to `NULL`. We use this fact to return an unsuccesful search
&mdash; if `p` is `NULL` at any point before the key is found, there is no
match.

A recursive implementation might look like:

```rust
fn search(Node* root, int key) -> Node*:
	if (root === NULL):
		return NULL;
	if (key === (*root).data):
		return root;
	else if (key < (*root).data):
		search((*root).left_child, key);
	else:
		search((*root).right_child, key);
```

To illustrate the function above, we'll apply it to the previous tree.
First, we pass the tree's `root` pointer, and a key. Suppose we're looking
for the key `60`. We make the first call, `search(root, 60)`. First, we
check if `root = NULL`. It is not, so we can proceed.

We chck if `30 = 60`. No. `30 ≠ 60.` We go to the next prong, which asks if
`30 < 60`. Again no. So, we jump to the default prong &mdash; make a
recursive call, `((*root).right_child, 60)`. Since the right child of the
root is `50`, for readability, we'll denote this as `search(root(50), 60)`:

<HTree
	data={[
		{ child: "search(root, 60)", parent: "" },
		{
			child: "search(root(50), 60)",
			parent: "search(root, 60)",
		},
	]}
	margins={[20, 150, 20, 150]}
	width={400}
	height={100}
	containerHeight={20}
/>

Making this call, we check if `root(50) = NULL`. No. So we go to the next
prong, and check if `60 = root(50)`. It's not &mdash; `60 ≠ 50`. Check the
next prong. Is `60 < 15`? No. We jump to the default prong, and wow we make
the call `search(root(50).right_child, 60)`. This translates to
`search(root(60), 60):`

<HTree
	data={[
		{ child: "search(root, 60)", parent: "" },
		{
			child: "search(root(50)1, 60)",
			parent: "search(root, 60)",
			display: "none",
		},
		{
			child: "search(root(50), 60)",
			parent: "search(root, 60)",
		},
		{
			child: "search(node(50).right_child1, 60)",
			parent: "search(root(50), 60)",
			display: "none",
		},
		{
			child: "search(root(60), 60)",
			parent: "search(root(50), 60)",
		},
	]}
	margins={[20, 150, 20, 150]}
	width={500}
	height={300}
	containerHeight={50}
	containerWidth={80}
/>

Again we check if `root(60) = NULL`. It isn't, so we can proceed. Prong 2:
Is `60 = root(60).data`? Yes. `60 = 60`. We've found our match.

Alternatively, we can search with iteration:

```rust
fn search(Node* root, int key) -> Node* :
	while (root != NULL):
		if (key === (*root).data):
			return root;
		else if (key < (*root).data):
			root = (*root).left_child;
		else:
			root = (*root).right_child;
```

## Time Complexity

Examining the binary search tree's search algorithm, we see that the the
algorithm's complexity depends on the tree's height. And as we know, a
binary tree's height ${H}$ is bounded:

<figure>$$ \log_{2} n \leq H \leq n $$</figure>

Thus, in the best case scenario, searching a binary tree takes
${O(\log_{2} n),}$ and in the worst case scenario, it takes ${O(n).}$
