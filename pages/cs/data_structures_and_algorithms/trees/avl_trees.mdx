In this section, we examine **Adelson-Velsky &amp; Landis trees**, commonly
known as **AVL-trees**.[^avlnote] AVL-trees are _height-balanced binary
search trees._ Accordingly, they are a subset of balanced binary trees:

[^avlnote]:
    AVL-trees were invented in 1962, and named after their inventors,
    Soviet mathematicians Georgy Adelson-Velsky (8 January 1922&ndash;26
    April 2014) and Evgenii Mikhailovich Landis (6 October 1921&ndash;12
    December 1997).

    Born in Samara, Russia, Adelson-Velsky is known for introducing
    _bitboards_, a bit array data structure now widely used to represent
    game positions in computer chess. Adelson-Velsky's chess program
    participated and won the first chess match between computer programs
    in 1966. The AVL-tree, in particular, was borne out of Adelson-Velsky's
    work in artificial intelligence.

    His colleague, Evgenii Landis, was equally accomplished. Born in
    Kharkiv, Ukraine, Landis fought in Finland as a lieutenant in the Red
    Army, where he was wounded, frost-bitten, and severely shell-shocked.
    The traumas of war impaired his ability to hear high-pitched tones, to
    which Landis lamented his inability to hear violin flageolets. Despite
    these difficulties, Landis made numerous contributions to the field of
    partial differential equations, alongside his collaboration with
    Adelson-Velsky in inventing the AVL-tree.

Given this fact, we might guess that there are various ways of defining
what it means to be "balanced." And in fact, we would guess correctly. The
term _balanced tree_, without more, could mean many things. Do we mean
balanced in terms of weight? Height? Depth? Order? Node categories?

For AVL-trees, we define "balanced" in terms of height. And to construct
that definition, we need a way of quantifying _balance_. We do so by
defining a **height balance factor**:

> _Definition: Height Balance Factor_. Let ${n}$ be a node in some tree.
> The _height balance factor_ of ${n}$ is defined as:
>
> $$
> 	\textit{\textsf{BF}}(n) = \textit{\textsf{H}}(\textit{\textsf{LST}}(n)) - \textit{\textsf{H}}(\textit{\textsf{RST}}(n))
> $$
>
> where:
>
> - ${\textit{\textsf{BF}}(n)}$ is the height balance factor of the node
>   ${n,}$
> - ${\textit{\textsf{H}}(\textit{\textsf{LST}}(n))}$ is the height of the
>   left-subtree of the node ${n,}$ and
> - ${\textit{\textsf{H}}(\textit{\textsf{RST}}(n))}$ is the height of the
>   right-subtree of the node ${n.}$

To understand this definition, it's important to recall the definitions for
height:

> _Definition: Height of a Node_. Let ${n}$ be a node in some rooted tree.
> The height of ${n,}$ denoted ${\textit{\textsf{H}}(n),}$ is the number of
> nodes, including the starting and end nodes, along the longest strictly
> downward path from ${n}$ to a leaf.

Note that there are two different definitions for the height of a node. An
alternative definition is:

> _Definition: Height of a Node_. Let ${x}$ be a node in some tree ${T.}$
> The height of ${x,}$ denoted ${\textit{\textsf{H}}(x),}$ is the number of
> edges in the longest strictly-downward path from ${x}$ to a leaf.

The key difference between this definition and the one we will use is
whether a leaf has a height of ${0}$ or ${1.}$ The existence of two
differing definitions for node height is similar to the situation of
natural numbers in mathematics—does the set of natural numbers include
${0?}$ Some say yes, others no.

In response to this debate, we take the pragmatic approach. In some
situations, it's more convenient to define the height of a node as the
number of edges along the path, since this implies that a balanced binary
tree of height ${H}$ has ${2^H}$ leaves. If we defined it as the number of
nodes along the path (number of edges plus ${1}$), we would have ${H + 1}$
or ${H-1}$ leaves. For the purposes of AVL-trees, we use the definition
presented in the main text.

> _Definition: Height of a Tree_. Let ${\textsf{T}}$ be some rooted tree.
> The height of ${\textsf{T},}$ denoted
> ${\textit{\textsf{H}}(\textsf{T}),}$ is the height of its root node.

From the height balance factor ${\textit{\textsf{BF}},}$ we have the
definition of an AVL tree:

> _Definition: avl-tree_. Let ${A}$ be a binary tree. ${A}$ is an
> _AVL-tree_ if, and only if, for every node ${n \in A,}$
>
> <figure>$$ \textit{\textsf{BF}}(n) \in \{ -1, 0, 1 \} $$</figure>
>
> Or, alternatively:
>
> <figure>$$\lvert \textit{\textsf{BF}}(n) \rvert \leq 1 $$</figure>

Following the definition above, if the absolute value of the balance factor
of some node ${x}$ is greater than or equal to ${1,}$ we say that the node
${x}$ is _height-imbalanced._ Moreover, to determine if a particular tree
${T}$ is an AVL-tree, we must calculate the height balance factor for each
node in ${T.}$ If a single node in ${T}$ is imbalanced, we conclude that
${T}$ is height-imbalanced. If the tree is imbalanced, we can attempt to
balance the tree by performing _rotations_, as we'll see later.

That said, let's consider a few examples. Below are several binary trees,
with their heights indicated.

<Tree data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "a" },
		{ child: "d", parent: "b" },

		{ child: "g", parent: "c", display: "none" },

]} markHeight={true}/>

<Tree

		{ child: "c", parent: "a" },
		{ child: "d", parent: "b" },
		{ child: "e", parent: "b", display: "none" },
		{ child: "f", parent: "c", display: "none" },
		{ child: "g", parent: "c" },
	]}
	markHeight={true}
/>

<Tree
	data={[

		{ child: "b", parent: "a" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "a" },
		{ child: "d", parent: "b" },
		{ child: "e", parent: "b", display: "none" },
		{ child: "h", parent: "d" },
		{ child: "i", parent: "d", display: "none" },
	]}
	markHeight={true}
/>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "a" },
		{ child: "d", parent: "b" },
		{ child: "e", parent: "b", display: "none" },
		{ child: "h", parent: "d", display: "none" },
		{ child: "i", parent: "d" },
		{ child: "j", parent: "i" },
		{ child: "k", parent: "i", display: "none" },
	]}
	markHeight={true}
/>

Examining each tree, we have the following tables of balance factors:

From the tables above, we can see that trees ${\texttt{C}}$ and
${\texttt{D}}$ are imbalanced. The same trees are presented below with
their balance factors indicated (red for imbalanced, green for balanced).

	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "" },

Now that we know what it means for a tree to be imbalanced, let's examine
_rotating_—the act of correct height imbalances.

## Rotations

If we think carefully about height-imbalanced trees, we find that there are
really only four situations where a binary tree is height-imbalanced. Why?
Because to have a height-imbalanced binary tree, we need, at a minimum,
three nodes. This follows from the definition of a height-balanced binary
tree—to determine if a binary tree is height-balanced, we must compare the
left- and right-subtrees of the root. And to reach the conclusion that a
binary tree is height-imbalanced, the root must have a right- and
left-child to begin with; three nodes total.

As we know from the _Catalan number formula_, given three nodes, there are
five possible binary trees:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "", label: "none" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a", label: "none" },
		{ child: "1", parent: "a", display: "none" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "b", label: "none" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "b", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "", label: "none" },
		{ child: "1", parent: "a", display: "none" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a", label: "none" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "b", display: "none" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "b", label: "none" },
	]}
/>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "", label: "none" },
		{ child: "1", parent: "a", display: "none" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a", label: "none" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "b", label: "none" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "b", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "", label: "none" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a", label: "none" },
		{ child: "1", parent: "a", display: "none" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "b", display: "none" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "b", label: "none" },
	]}
/>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "", label: "none" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a", label: "none" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "a", label: "none" },
	]}
/>

Of the possibilities above, only ${\texttt{P5}}$ is balanced. Given that
all subtrees of a binary tree are binary trees, it follows that there are
only four possible cases for height-imbalanced trees:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a" },
		{ child: "1", parent: "a", display: "none" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "b" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "b", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "" },
		{ child: "1", parent: "a", display: "none" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "b", display: "none" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "b" },
	]}
/>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "" },
		{ child: "1", parent: "a", display: "none" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "b" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "b", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a" },
		{ child: "1", parent: "a", display: "none" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "b", display: "none" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "b" },
	]}
/>

Because there are only four possible cases, there are only four methods for
height-balancing some binary tree. These methods are called **rotations**:
_right rotation_, _left rotation_, _right-left rotation_, and _left-right
rotation_.

### Right rotation

Suppose some user is entering a binary tree traversal sequence to construct
a tree ${T.}$ After the first two entries, the binary tree appears as:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "a", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

The user then enters another element:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a" },
		{ child: "d", parent: "a", display: "none" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "b" },
		{ child: "e", parent: "b", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

At this point, the tree is imbalanced. Why? Because ${\texttt{node(a)}}$
has a left-subtree of height ${2,}$ and a right-subtree of height ${0.}$
Thus, the tree has an overall balance factor of
${\textit{\textsf{BF}} = 2 - 0 = 2.}$ We demarcate this situation as
${T:LL_i}$ to convey the proposition that the tree ${T}$ is
_left-left-imbalanced_, which in turn conveys: An imbalance occurred at the
left-subtree of the left-subtree of ${T.}$

Now, because we have ${T:LL_i,}$ we perform an **right-rotation**:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a", focus: "red" },
		{ child: "d", parent: "a", display: "none" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "b" },
		{ child: "e", parent: "b", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

<figure>$$ \Large \overset{\texttt{right-rotate}}{\curvearrowright} $$</figure>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "b", parent: "", focus: "red" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "b" },
		{ child: "a", parent: "b" },
	]}
/>

<div id="rotate4"></div>

The RR-rotation consists of the following steps:

1. ${\texttt{node(b)},}$ the node just before the imbalance-causing node—in
   this case, ${\texttt{node(c)}}$—becomes the new root. We call
   ${\texttt{node(b)}}$ the **pivot**.

2. ${\texttt{node(a)},}$ formerly the root, becomes the right-child of
   ${\texttt{node(b)},}$ with ${\texttt{node(b)}'s}$ right-child as its
   left-child. In the case above, ${\texttt{node(b)}}$'s right-child is
   ${\texttt{NULL}.}$

3. ${\texttt{node(a)}}$ remains the left-child of ${\texttt{node(b)}.}$

One way to think about the right-rotation operation is to imagine holding
down the pivot, and pulling the node to its right down. (Hence the term
_pivot_). Alternatively, we can think of the right-rotation as it sounds
like—the nodes move towards the right, transitioning from the shape
${~~/~~}$ to the shape ${~~\land~~.}$

The right-rotation operation works regardless of how many nodes there are.
For example, suppose we have the following tree:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a" },
		{ child: "d", parent: "a", type: "subtree" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "b" },
		{ child: "e", parent: "b", type: "subtree" },
		{ child: "f", parent: "c", type: "subtree" },
		{ child: "g", parent: "c", type: "subtree" },
	]}
	edgeLength={100}
/>

In the diagram above, the nodes without circles indicate that there are
further subtrees. Importantly, the fact that the pivot,
${\texttt{node(b)},}$ has a balance factor of ${1}$ indicates that this
tree is left-heavy. Accordingly, we have a right-rotation:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "b", parent: "" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "b" },
		{ child: "a", parent: "b" },
		{ child: "e", parent: "a", type: "subtree" },
		{ child: "d", parent: "a", type: "subtree" },
		{ child: "f", parent: "c", type: "subtree" },
		{ child: "g", parent: "c", type: "subtree" },
	]}
/>

### Left rotation

Now suppose the user enters the tree:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "" },
		{ child: "1", parent: "a", display: "none" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "b", display: "none" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "b" },
	]}
/>

Here, we have an **RR-imbalanced tree**. To balance this tree, we must
perform a **left-rotation**:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "" },
		{ child: "d", parent: "a", display: "none" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a", focus: "red" },
		{ child: "e", parent: "b", display: "none" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "b" },
	]}
/>

<figure>$$ \Large \overset{\texttt{left-rotate}}{\curvearrowleft} $$</figure>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "b", parent: "", focus: "red" },
		{ child: "a", parent: "b" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "b" },
	]}
/>

The procedure:

1. The pivot ${\texttt{node(b)},}$ becomes the new root. .

2. ${\texttt{node(a)},}$ formerly the root, becomes the

3. <em>left-child</em> of ${\texttt{node(b)}.}$

${\texttt{node(c)}}$ remains the right-child of ${\texttt{node(b)}.}$

### Right-left Rotation

Now we examine the third case. Suppose the user enters:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "" },
		{ child: "1", parent: "a", display: "none" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "b" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "b", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

We say that this tree is **right-left imbalanced**. To balance this tree,
we perform a right-left rotation:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "" },
		{ child: "1", parent: "a", display: "none" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a" },
		{
			child: "c",
			parent: "b",
			focus: "red",
		},
		{ child: "2", parent: "b", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

<figure>$$ \Large \overset{\texttt{right-rotate}}{\curvearrowright} $$</figure>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "" },
		{ child: "1", parent: "a", display: "none" },
		{
			child: "c",
			parent: "a",
			focus: "red",
		},
		{ child: "2", parent: "c", display: "none" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "c" },
	]}
/>

<figure>$$ \Large \overset{\texttt{left-rotate}}{\curvearrowleft} $$</figure>

### Left-right Rotation

Now we examine the final case. Suppose the user enters:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a" },
		{ child: "1", parent: "a", display: "none" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "b", display: "none" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "b" },
	]}
/>

We say that this tree is **left-right imbalanced**. To balance this tree,
we perform a left-right rotation:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "a" },
		{ child: "1", parent: "a", display: "none" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "b", display: "none" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "b", focus: "red" },
	]}
/>

<figure>$$ \Large \overset{\texttt{left-rotate}}{\curvearrowleft} $$</figure>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "a", parent: "" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "a", focus: "red" },
		{ child: "1", parent: "a", display: "none" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "c" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "c", display: "none" },

## General Form of AVL Rotations

AVL tree rotations have a general form. Consider the following tree:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "A", parent: "" },
		{ child: "B", parent: "A" },
		{ child: "AR", parent: "A", noCircle: true },
		{ child: "C", parent: "B" },
		{ child: "BR", parent: "B", noCircle: true },
		{ child: "CL", parent: "C", noCircle: true },
		{ child: "CR", parent: "C", noCircle: true },
	]}
	markBalanceFactor={true}
	edgeLength={100}
/>

The nodes without circles indicate that the child node is the root to some
larger subtree. In this case, we see that `Node(A)` is imbalanced — it has
a balance factor of 2. Given that `Node(B)` has a balance factor of 1, we
see that the rotation should be an LL-rotation. If `Node(B)` had a balance
factor of -1, the rotation would be an LR-rotation.

More generally:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th style={{ width: "50%" }}>Tree</th>
			<th>Imbalance</th>
			<th>Procedure</th>

	</thead>
	<tbody>

Returning to our imbalanced tree, how do we balance this tree knowing it
potentially has thousands of other nodes in those subtrees? The idea is to
just momentarily ignore the fact that those subtrees exist. Performing the
LL-rotation, we get:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "B", parent: "" },
		{ child: "C", parent: "B" },
		{ child: "A", parent: "B" },
	]}
	markBalanceFactor={true}
	containerHeight={20}
/>

Now we see that it's balanced. The subtrees are now:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "B", parent: "" },
		{ child: "C", parent: "B" },
		{ child: "A", parent: "B" },
		{ child: "BR", parent: "A", noCircle: true },
		{ child: "AR", parent: "A", noCircle: true },
		{ child: "CL", parent: "C", noCircle: true },
		{ child: "CR", parent: "C", noCircle: true },
	]}
	markBalanceFactor={true}
	containerHeight={50}
/>

Ok hang on. How did those subtrees move? A helpful way to think about how
the subtrees got to their positions is to imagine the links between each
node as a thread:

<Fig
	link={
		"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1653782339/cs/avl_tree_pull_pa1lkc.svg"
	}
	caption={"Imagining the links between each node as a string"}
	width={"100"}
	imwidth={"915"}
	imheight={"199"}
/>

Notice that by pulling the thread, the subtree slowly goes up, until it
arrives at its final location.
