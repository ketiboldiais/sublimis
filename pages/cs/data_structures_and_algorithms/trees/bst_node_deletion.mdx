# Deleting BST Nodes

We have the following tree:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "30", parent: "" },
		{ child: "15", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "50", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "10", parent: "15" },
		{ child: "20", parent: "15" },
		{ child: "40", parent: "50" },
		{ child: "60", parent: "50" },
		{ child: "55", parent: "60" },
		{ child: "70", parent: "60" },
	]}
/>

Now suppose that we're asked to delete a node associated with a particular
value in the tree. Call it the _target node_. How might we do so? Once
again, because we know how to search for nodes, deleting is _almost_
trivial, at least for tree's leaves. We just to search for the particular
node containing the key, then delete if found. For the leaves, this is
straightforward. If we wanted to delete the node containing `70`, we just
have call `search(root, 70)`, then, when we get to `70`, delete:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "30", parent: "" },
		{ child: "15", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "50", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "10", parent: "15" },
		{ child: "20", parent: "15" },
		{ child: "40", parent: "50" },
		{ child: "60", parent: "50" },
		{ child: "55", parent: "60" },
		{ child: "70", parent: "60", opacity: 0.15 },
	]}
/>

All that's left to do after deleting `node(70)` is to ensure its parent,
`node(60)` has its left-child pointer set to `NULL`. Now, we emphasized
_almost_ trivial because there's a bit of a troublesome case: Deleting
branch nodes. For example, suppose we were asked to delete the node
containing `60`. If we just blindly deleted the node, we'd end up with:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "30", parent: "" },
		{ child: "15", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "50", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "10", parent: "15" },
		{ child: "20", parent: "15" },
		{ child: "40", parent: "50" },
		{ child: "60", parent: "50", opacity: 0.15 },
		{ child: "55", parent: "60" },
		{ child: "70", parent: "60", opacity: 0.15 },
	]}
/>

We've partitioned the tree, and that's likely not what we intended. But
even if we did, assuming the only way to access the tree was through a
single `root` pointer, the other tree &mdash; `node(55)` &mdash; is lost in
memory; from a practical perspective, we've essentially destroyed it.

To avoid this problem: Before deletion, always check if the target node is
a branch node or a leaf node. If the target node is a branch node with only
one child, as is the case with `node(60)`, then the target node must take
its parent's place after deletion:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "30", parent: "" },
		{ child: "15", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "50", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "10", parent: "15" },
		{ child: "20", parent: "15" },
		{ child: "40", parent: "50" },
		{ child: "55", parent: "50" },
	]}
/>

This avoids partitioning, but only for deleting uniparous nodes. What if we
were now asked to delete `node(50)`? Once again, blindly deleting causes a
partition:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "30", parent: "" },
		{ child: "15", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "50", parent: "30", opacity: 0.1 },
		{ child: "10", parent: "15" },
		{ child: "20", parent: "15" },
		{ child: "40", parent: "50" },
		{ child: "55", parent: "50" },
	]}
/>

There are several ways to avoid this problem. One way is to fill the
newly-emptied position with the target node's _inorder predecesor_. In
other words, fill the vacancy with the node that comes before the target
node within the tree's inorder traversal sequence. For our tree above, the
inorder traversal sequence is:

$$
	\lang 10, 15, 20, 30, {\color{forestgreen}{40}}, {\color{indianred}{50}}, {\color{dodgerblue}55} \rang
$$

and we can see that `node(40)` comes before `node(50)`. Above, we've also
indicated the blue-colored `node(55)`, `node(50)`'s _inorder successor_.
Thus, if we delete a biparous node, we can choose either the inorder
predecesor or the inorder successor to fill the vacancy:

Inorder predecessor sucession:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "30", parent: "" },
		{ child: "15", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "40", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "56", parent: "40", display: "none" },
		{ child: "55", parent: "40" },
		{ child: "10", parent: "15" },
		{ child: "20", parent: "15" },
	]}
/>

Inorder successor succession:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "30", parent: "" },
		{ child: "15", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "55", parent: "30" },
		{ child: "40", parent: "55" },
		{ child: "41", parent: "55", display: "none" },
		{ child: "10", parent: "15" },
		{ child: "20", parent: "15" },
	]}
/>

Given the binary search tree's structure, finding either of these
successors is easy enough, per the following lemmas:

> _Definition: Inorder Predecesor_. Let ${N}$ be a node in a binary search
> tree ${B.}$ The <b>inorder predecesor</b> of ${N}$ is the rightmost child
> of ${B}$'s left subtree.

> _Definition: Inorder Successor_. Let ${N}$ be a node in a binary search
> tree ${B.}$ The <b>inorder successor</b> of ${N}$ is the leftmost child
> of ${B}$'s right subtree.

We call this vacancy-filling technique _inorder-succession_. Having given a
broad overview of how the technique works, let's point out some of the
flaws with this technique. First, suppose we had the following tree:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "10", parent: "" },
		{ child: "a", parent: "10", display: "none" },
		{ child: "90", parent: "10" },
		{ child: "20", parent: "90" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "90", display: "none" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "20", display: "none" },
		{ child: "80", parent: "20" },
		{ child: "30", parent: "80" },
		{ child: "d", parent: "80", display: "none" },
		{ child: "e", parent: "30", display: "none" },
		{ child: "70", parent: "30" },
	]}
	edgeLength={100}
/>

The inorder traversal squence for this tree is:

$$
	\lang 10, 20, 30, 70, 80, 90 \rang
$$

If we deleted `node(20)` using inorder-successor-succession, then we
suddenly have to perform several successions:

Before deletion. No changes.

$$
	\lang 10, 20, 30, 70, 80, 90 \rang
$$

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "10", parent: "" },
		{ child: "a", parent: "10", display: "none" },
		{ child: "90", parent: "10" },
		{ child: "20", parent: "90" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "90", display: "none" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "20", display: "none" },
		{ child: "80", parent: "20" },
		{ child: "30", parent: "80" },
		{ child: "d", parent: "80", display: "none" },
		{ child: "e", parent: "30", display: "none" },
		{ child: "70", parent: "30" },
	]}
	edgeLength={100}
/>

Remove `node(20)`. There's a vacancy that must be filled, and because we're
using inorder-successor-succession, `node(30)` must rise to fill the
vacancy. In this case, it becomes the left-child of `node(90)`.

$$
	\lang 10, 30, \square, 70, 80, 90 \rang
$$

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "10", parent: "" },
		{ child: "a", parent: "10", display: "none" },
		{ child: "90", parent: "10", arrowTo: 7 },
		{ child: "20", parent: "90", opacity: 0.1 },
		{ child: "b", parent: "90", display: "none" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "20", display: "none" },
		{ child: "80", parent: "20" },
		{ child: "30", parent: "80" },
		{ child: "d", parent: "80", display: "none" },
		{ child: "e", parent: "30", display: "none" },
		{ child: "70", parent: "30" },
	]}
	edgeLength={100}
/>

The previous step results in a vacancy, and now `node(70)` must succeed.

$$
	\lang 10, 30, 70, \square, 80, 90 \rang
$$

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "10", parent: "" },
		{ child: "a", parent: "10", display: "none" },
		{ child: "90", parent: "10", arrowTo: 7 },
		{ child: "20", parent: "90", opacity: 0.2 },
		{ child: "b", parent: "90", display: "none" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "20", display: "none" },
		{ child: "80", parent: "20", arrowTo: 10 },
		{ child: "30", parent: "80" },
		{ child: "d", parent: "80", display: "none" },
		{ child: "e", parent: "30", display: "none" },
		{ child: "70", parent: "30" },
	]}
	edgeLength={100}
/>

Now `node(80)` must succeed.

$$
	\lang 10, 30, 70, 80, \square, 90 \rang
$$

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "10", parent: "" },
		{ child: "a", parent: "10", display: "none" },
		{ child: "90", parent: "10" },
		{ child: "30", parent: "90" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "90", display: "none" },
		{ child: "d", parent: "80", display: "none" },
		{ child: "f", parent: "70", display: "none" },
		{ child: "80", parent: "70" },
		{ child: "e", parent: "30", display: "none" },
		{ child: "70", parent: "30" },
	]}
	edgeLength={100}
/>

And finally, `node(90)` must succeed, which means `node(30)` must succeed.

$$
	\lang 10, 30, 70, 80, 90 \rang
$$

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "10", parent: "" },
		{ child: "a", parent: "10", display: "none" },
		{ child: "30", parent: "10" },
		{ child: "20", parent: "90", display: "none" },
		{ child: "b", parent: "90", display: "none" },
		{ child: "c", parent: "20", display: "none" },
		{ child: "f", parent: "70", display: "none" },
		{ child: "80", parent: "70" },
		{ child: "g", parent: "80", display: "none" },
		{ child: "90", parent: "80" },
		{ child: "e", parent: "30", display: "none" },
		{ child: "70", parent: "30" },
	]}
	edgeLength={100}
/>

## Time Complexity

Examining this process, we see that the time complexity for removing nodes
depends on the tree's height. We must search &mdash; i.e., traverse &mdash;
the tree and modify accordingly.
