# Binary Search Tree Costs

As with all data structures, there are costs to binary search trees. The
BST's most significant cost is the lack of control over order of insertion.
For example, the following traversal sequences have the same keys, but
generate two different trees:

<Sequence
	data={[
		{ val: 40 },
		{ val: 20 },
		{ val: 30 },
		{ val: 60 },
		{ val: 50 },
		{ val: 10 },
		{ val: 70 },
	]}
/>

<Sequence
	data={[
		{ val: 10 },
		{ val: 20 },
		{ val: 30 },
		{ val: 40 },
		{ val: 50 },
		{ val: 60 },
		{ val: 70 },
	]}
/>

Notice that ${\texttt{T}_1}$ has a height of ${2,}$ while ${\texttt{T}_2}$
has a height of ${6.}$ Two different heights for the same set of keys! This
shows that a BST's height depends on the order of key insertion.

Can we control the order of insertion? With what we have so far, no.
Ultimately, how the keys are inserted is up to the user. If the user
inserts the keys according to ${\texttt{T}_1}$'s traversal sequence, then
they'll get the tree ${\texttt{T}_1.}$ But if they insert the keys
according to ${\texttt{T}_2}$ then they'll get the tree ${\texttt{T}_2.}$

Because of this problem, we need a way to control the height of a binary
search tree. Fortunately, there's a solution &mdash; AVL trees.
