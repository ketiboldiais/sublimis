# Order Determination

Suppose we want to determine a binary tree's order (the number of nodes in
the binary tree). Given what we know about traversals, one way to do so is
to traverse the entire tree, counting each time we visit a node:

Below, we have a function called `TreeOrder()`. This function takes a
`Node` pointer as an argument, and returns an `int`. Inside `TreeOrder()`,
we have two local variables, `x` and `y`. These variables will keep track
of the count for the left-subtrees and right-subtrees respectively. As long
as `root` is not `NULL`, we will traverse the subtrees. At some point, we
reachl a leaf, in which case we go to line `6`: `return 0`. This ultimately
leads to the final line in the if-block: `return x + y + 1`.

```rust
TreeOrder(Node* root) -> int :
	int x, y;
	if (root != NULL):
		x = TreeOrder((*root).left_child);
		y = TreeOrder((*root).right_child);
		return x + y + 1;
	return 0;
```

Notice that this algorithm uses postorder traversal. This isn't necessarily
some arbitrary decision. For post applications, binary tree processing is
done with post-order traversal.

What if instead we wanted to only count the nodes with a degree of two? To
do so, we use the following:

```rust
TreeOrder2(Node* root) -> int :
	int x, y;
	if (root != NULL):
		x = TreeOrder2((*root).left_child);
		y = TreeOrder2((*root).right_child);
		if ((*root).left_child && (*root).right_child):
			return x + y + 1;
		else
			return x + y;
	return 0;
```
