# Binary Trees

Binary trees are a core data structure behind much of the software products
and services we use today: The most common use case is the _binary search
tree_, used in numerous search applications where data is constantly ebbing
and flowing in a given system. _Binary space partition_ is used in nearly
all 3D video games for determining which objects must be rerendered.
_Binary tries_ are used in nearly all high-bandwidth routers for storing
_router-tables_, large address books that routers use to direct internet
traffic. _Huffman coding trees_ are binary trees used in compression
algorithms, most notably the .jpeg and .mp3 file formats. _Syntax trees_
are used by compilers and calculators to parse user-input expressions. The
list goes on.

Why are binary trees more commonly used than ternary trees or other
${n}$-ary trees? Simply because ${n}$-ary trees are much more complicated.
While we can do many interesting things with ${n}$-ary trees, we gain
little in terms of speed. And as we know, speed is everything when it comes
to data structures. Of course, ${n}$-ary trees outperform binary trees in
certain situations, but the fact is, binary trees are easier to work with
and cover more problem domains.

So, what are binary trees, really? Binary trees are a special kind of tree.
They consist of _nodes_ in a _parent-child relationship_. All binary trees
have a single root—what we might think of as the _first node_, just as Adam
was the first man or Eve the first woman—from which all other nodes
descend. Moreover, binary trees have a two-child policy—all nodes can have
at most two children.

Because of these properties, we say that all binary trees are trees, but
not all trees are binary trees. Accordingly, we have at our disposal all
the usual arboreal terms:

- The **root** is the top, or first, node in the tree.
- A **child** is a node directly descending from a node.
- The **parent** of a node ${n}$ is the node ${n}$ descends from.
- **Siblings** are nodes with the same parent.
- A **leaf** is a node with no children.
- A **fork** is a node with children.
- An **edge** is the connection between a child node and its parent.

In general, there are two approaches to implementing binary trees:

1. array implementation
2. linked list implementation

We begin first with the array implementation.

## ABTs

As its name implies, an **array-implemented binary tree (ABT)** is a binary
tree implemented, and represented, with an array. First, we have the
following binary tree, with an accompanying empty array:

<BinaryTree
	data={[
		["A", ["B", "C"]],
		["B", ["D", "E"]],
		["C", ["F", "G"]],
	]}
/>

<Sequence data={[" ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " "]} scale={50} />

The challenge: How do we store each node in this binary tree in the array
such that the relationships between the nodes are preserved? For example,
`B` is the left child of `A`, and `C` is the right child of `A`. How is
that information preserved in an array implementation?

Here's an idea: Use the array's indices. Let's start by storing the
elements from the top generation to the bottom generation, left to right.
At ${L = 1,}$ we have a single node, `A`. So we store in the array:

<Sequence data={["A", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " "]} scale={50} />

At ${L = 2,}$ we have two nodes, `B` and `C`, so we store, from left to
right, `B` then `C`:

<Sequence data={["A", "B", "C", " ", " ", " ", " "]} scale={50} />

Then, we go on to ${L = 3,}$ and see that there are ${4}$ nodes &mdash;
`D`, `E`, `F`, and `G`. Again we store the nodes from left to right:

<Sequence data={["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G"]} scale={50} />

Let's construct a table to see if we can find a pattern. Suppose ${i}$ is
an index in the array, ${i_L}$ is the index of the left child, and ${i_R}$
is the index of the right child.

| Element | ${i}$ | ${i_L}$         | ${i_R}$         |
| ------- | ----- | --------------- | --------------- |
| `A`     | ${0}$ | ${1}$           | ${2}$           |
| `B`     | ${1}$ | ${3}$           | ${4}$           |
| `C`     | ${2}$ | ${5}$           | ${6}$           |
| `D`     | ${3}$ | ${\varnothing}$ | ${\varnothing}$ |
| `E`     | ${4}$ | ${\varnothing}$ | ${\varnothing}$ |
| `F`     | ${5}$ | ${\varnothing}$ | ${\varnothing}$ |
| `G`     | ${6}$ | ${\varnothing}$ | ${\varnothing}$ |

Examining the table, we see that at the first generation, the element's
left child is offset by ${1,}$ and its right child is offset by ${2.}$ For
the left node on the second generation, the element's left child is offset
by ${2}$ and its right child is offset by ${3.}$ For the right node on the
second generation, the element's left child is offset by ${3}$ and its
right child is offset by ${4.}$ Examining these mappings we that, to get
the left child, we use:

$$
	i_L = 2i + 1
$$

and to get the right child, we use:

$$
	i_R = 2i + 2
$$

These two formulas allow us to access the left and right children. But what
about the parents? Well, let's construct another table, where ${i_P}$ is
the index of the given element's parent.

| Element | ${i}$ | ${i_P}$         |
| ------- | ----- | --------------- |
| `A`     | ${0}$ | ${\varnothing}$ |
| `B`     | ${1}$ | ${0}$           |
| `C`     | ${2}$ | ${0}$           |
| `D`     | ${3}$ | ${1}$           |
| `E`     | ${4}$ | ${1}$           |
| `F`     | ${5}$ | ${2}$           |
| `G`     | ${6}$ | ${2}$           |

Examining this table, we see that given an element with the index ${i,}$
the index of its parent is:

$$
	i_P = \left\lfloor \dfrac{i}{2} \right\rfloor
$$

This is a fairly useful piece of information, so we state it as a lemma:

> _Lemma_. Let ${A}$ be an array representing an array-implemented binary
> tree, and ${i}$ an index in the array. Given a branch node ${A[i],}$ the
> left child of ${A[i]}$ has the index ${i_L,}$ where
>
> $$
> 	  i_L = 2i + 1
> $$
>
> and the right child of ${A[i]}$ has the index ${i_R,}$ where
>
> $$
> 	  i_R = 2i + 2
> $$

The **linked-list-implemented binary tree (LBT)** looks similar to a
general linked list in implementation. Usually, there's a _root pointer_, a
pointer in the stack whose pointee is the _root_ of the binary tree. For
the binary tree, each node has ${2}$ _next fields_ &mdash; one for a
`leftChild` pointer and one for the `rightChild` pointer, and ${1}$ _data
field_. Furthermore, each node in the tree, other than the root node, is
the lone pointee of another node.

<Fig

		"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1652931183/cs/binary_tree_pointers.svg"
	}
	caption={"A low level visualization of a binary tree."}
	width={80}
	imwidth={765}
	imheight={493}
/>

Above, we see that each node is a square comprised of one left compartment
and one right compartment, beneath a larger compartment. The larger
compartment is called the data field, and stores the substantive data. The
left compartment houses the left subtree pointer, and the right compartment
houses the right subtree pointer.

For example, suppose we had the following binary tree:

<BinaryTree
	data={[
		["A", ["B", "C"]],
		["B", ["D", "E"]],
		["C", ["F", "G"]],
	]}
/>

This tree would be implemented as:

<Fig
	link={
		"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1652937072/cs/binary_tree_implementation.svg"
	}
	caption={"The tree's implementation"}
	width={50}
	imwidth={905}
	imheight={740}
/>

If we look at the representation, we see that there are ${7}$ nodes,
corresponding to the ${7}$ elements we seek to store. Notice that with
${7}$ nodes, there are ${8}$ null pointers. If there are ${N}$ nodes, then
are ${N + 1}$ null pointers.

To begin, we need to implement the basic `Node` data structure, as we saw
with linked lists, along with its constructor in pseudocode:

```rust
class Node {
	TYPE   data
	Node*  left
	Node*  right
}

class BinaryTree {
	Node* root = null
}
```

Here's a JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
export class Node {
	constructor(value) {
		this.value = value;
		this.left = null;
		this.right = null;
	}
}

export class BinarySearchTree {
	constructor() {
		this.root = null;
	}
}
```

## Dynamic Tree Constructor

Once we have the node record, we want to think about how to _generate_, or
create, the binary tree. In this section, we focus on a **dynamic tree
constructor** &mdash; a tree constructor that generates a tree at runtime.
The ideal starting point is the tree's root. Once we have a root, we create
the root's left-child and right-child. That said, we have to keep in mind
that there are four possiblities for a given node ${n}$'s lineage:

1. ${n}$ is leaf &mdash; it has ${0}$ children.
2. ${n}$ is left-uniparous &mdash; it has exactly ${1}$ left-child.
3. ${n}$ is right-uniparous &mdash; it has exactly ${1}$ right-child.
4. ${n}$ is full &mdash; it has exactly ${2}$ children.

These conditions boil down to two questions: (1) Does a left-child exist?
(2) Does a right-child exist?

| ${\exists (\texttt{left-child})}$ | ${\exists (\texttt{right-child})}$ | `node is`         |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `true`                            | `true`                             | `full`            |
| `true`                            | `false`                            | `left-uniparous`  |
| `false`                           | `true`                             | `right-uniparous` |
| `false`                           | `false`                            | `leaf`            |

To illustrate, we'll use the following binary tree, called `B1`:

<BinaryTree
	data={[
		[5, [8, 6]],
		[8, [null, 9]],
		[6, [3, null]],
		[9, [4, 2]],
	]}
/>

To implement the tree above, we will generate the binary tree generation by
generation, from left to right. More specifically, we generate the tree
using a _queue_.

```rust
Queue queue = newQueue();
```

<Queue data={["", "", "", "", ""]} scale={60} />

With the queue, we use the following procedure:

1. Create a root node.
2. Enqueue the address of the root node into `queue`.
3. Dequeue the address of the new node, name that address the pointer
   `p`.[^dequeuenote]
4. Using `p`, ask: Does `p` have a left child?
   1. Yes ${\implies}$ go to step 4.
   2. No ${\implies}$ go to step 5.
5. Create a pointer `t`.
6. Create a new node and assign it to `t`.
7. Initialize `p`'s `left_child` pointer as `t`.
8. Initialize `p`'s `right_child` pointer as `t`.
9. Using `p`, ask: Does `p` have a right child?
   1. Yes ${\implies}$ go to step 4.
   2. No ${\implies}$ go to step 5.
10. Enqueue the address of `t` into `queue.`
11. Return to step 3.

[^dequeuenote]:
    The operation `dequeue()` returns the address of the dequeued queuer.

Applying this procedure, the first step is to create the root node. For our
tree `B1`, this is the node ${n_5.}$

```rust
Node root = newNode(5); // address: F0
Queue queue = newQueue();
```

Let's say the address of `root` is some address `F0`. We take that address,
and insert it into the queue:

```rust
Node root = newNode(5);
Queue queue = newQueue();
queue.enqueue(root);
```

With these steps performed, we now have the first node in our tree:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "5", parent: "", ant: "F0" },
		{ child: "8", parent: "5", display: "none" },
		{ child: "6", parent: "5", display: "none" },
		{ child: "3", parent: "6", display: "none" },
		{ child: "", parent: "6", display: "none" },
		{ child: "", parent: "8", display: "none" },
		{ child: "9", parent: "8", display: "none" },
		{ child: "4", parent: "9", display: "none" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "9", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

<Queue data={["F0", "", "", "", ""]} scale={60} />

We then dequeue the address `F0`, and have a pointer `p` point to the
address `F0`.

```rust
	Node root = newNode(5);
	Queue queue = newQueue();
	queue.enqueue(root);
	Node* p = queue.dequeue();
```

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "5", parent: "", ant: "F0 p" },
		{ child: "8", parent: "5", display: "none" },
		{ child: "6", parent: "5", display: "none" },
		{ child: "3", parent: "6", display: "none" },
		{ child: "", parent: "6", display: "none" },
		{ child: "", parent: "8", display: "none" },
		{ child: "9", parent: "8", display: "none" },
		{ child: "4", parent: "9", display: "none" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "9", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

<Queue
	data={[
		{ val: "F0", focus: "red", ant: "p" },
		{ val: "" },
		{ val: "" },
		{ val: "" },
		{ val: "" },
		{ val: "" },
	]}
	scale={60}
/>

With `p` pointed to `F0`, we ask: "Does the node `p` have a left-child?"
Examining the tree `B1`, the answer is yes, the node `p` has a left child.
So, we use a temporary pointer `t` to create a new node, and have `p`'s
pointee's `left_child` pointer point to the new node:

```rust
	Node root = newNode(5);
	Queue queue = newQueue();
	queue.enqueue(root);
	Node* p = queue.dequeue();
	Node* t = newNode(8); `address: F1`
	(*p).left_child = t;
```

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "5", parent: "", ant: "F0 p" },
		{ child: "8", parent: "5", ant: "F1 t" },
		{ child: "6", parent: "5", display: "none" },
		{ child: "3", parent: "6", display: "none" },
		{ child: "", parent: "6", display: "none" },
		{ child: "", parent: "8", display: "none" },
		{ child: "9", parent: "8", display: "none" },
		{ child: "4", parent: "9", display: "none" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "9", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

<Queue
	data={[
		{ val: "F0", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "F1", ant: "t" },
		{ val: "" },
		{ val: "" },
		{ val: "" },
		{ val: "" },
	]}
	scale={60}
/>

Suppose the address of the new node is `F1`. We enqueue this address to our
queue:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "5", parent: "", ant: "F0 p" },
		{ child: "8", parent: "5", ant: "F1" },
		{ child: "6", parent: "5", ant: "F2 t" },
		{ child: "3", parent: "6", display: "none" },
		{ child: "", parent: "6", display: "none" },
		{ child: "", parent: "8", display: "none" },
		{ child: "9", parent: "8", display: "none" },
		{ child: "4", parent: "9", display: "none" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "9", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

<Queue
	data={[
		{ val: "F0", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "F1", ant: "t" },
		{ val: "" },
		{ val: "" },
		{ val: "" },
		{ val: "" },
	]}
	scale={60}
/>

With the left-child linked, we then ask the second question: "Does the node
`p` have a right-child?" Again, the answer is yes. We use the temporary
pointer `t` to create a new node, and have `p`'s pointee's `right_child`
pointer point to the new node:

```rust
	Node root = newNode(5);
	Queue queue = newQueue();
	queue.enqueue(root);
	Node* p = queue.dequeue();
	Node* t = newNode(8);
	(*p).left_child = t;
	t = newNode(6); `address: F2`
	(*p).right_child = t;
```

Let's say the address of the new node is `F2`. We enqueue this address to
our queue:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "5", parent: "", ant: "F0 p" },
		{ child: "8", parent: "5", ant: "F1" },
		{ child: "6", parent: "5", ant: "F2 t" },
		{ child: "3", parent: "6", display: "none" },
		{ child: "", parent: "6", display: "none" },
		{ child: "", parent: "8", display: "none" },
		{ child: "9", parent: "8", display: "none" },
		{ child: "4", parent: "9", display: "none" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "9", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

<Queue
	data={[
		{ val: "F0", focus: "red", ant: "p" },
		{ val: "F1" },
		{ val: "F2", ant: "t" },
		{ val: "" },
		{ val: "" },
		{ val: "" },
	]}
	scale={60}
/>

We now have the first generation taken care of. So we go to the next
generation, working from left to right.

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "5", parent: "", ant: "F0 p", opacity: 0.2 },
		{ child: "8", parent: "5", ant: "F1 t", opacity: 0.2 },
		{ child: "6", parent: "5", ant: "F2", opacity: 0.2 },
		{ child: "3", parent: "6" },
		{ child: "", parent: "6", display: "none" },
		{ child: "", parent: "8", display: "none" },
		{ child: "9", parent: "8" },
		{ child: "4", parent: "9", opacity: 0.2 },
		{ child: "2", parent: "9", opacity: 0.2 },
	]}
/>

We dequeue the address `F1`, and have the pointer `p` point to this
address.

```rust
Node root = newNode(5);
Queue queue = newQueue();
queue.enqueue(root);
Node* p = queue.dequeue();
Node* t = newNode(8);
(*p).left_child = t;
t = newNode(6);
(*p).right_child = t;
Node* p = queue.dequeue();
```

With `p` set, we ask, "Does the node `p` have a left-child?" No. So we ask
the next question: "Does the node `p` have a right child?" Yes. Use the
temporary pointer `t` to create a new node, enqueue `t`, and have `p`'s
right-child pointer point to `t`:

```rust
Node root = newNode(5);
Queue queue = newQueue();
queue.enqueue(root);
Node* p = queue.dequeue();
Node* t = newNode(8);
(*p).left_child = t;
t = newNode(6);
queue.enqueue(t);
(*p).right_child = t;
p = queue.dequeue();
t = newNode(9);
queue.enqueue(t);
(*p).right_child = t;
```

Now we have:

<Queue
	data={[
		{ val: "F0", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "F1", focus: "red", ant: "p" },
		{ val: "F2" },
		{ val: "F3", ant: "t" },
		{ val: "" },
		{ val: "" },
	]}
	scale={50}
/>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "5", parent: "", ant: "F0" },
		{ child: "8", parent: "5", ant: "F1 p" },
		{ child: "6", parent: "5", ant: "F2" },
		{ child: "3", parent: "6", display: "none" },
		{ child: "", parent: "6", display: "none" },
		{ child: "", parent: "8", display: "none" },
		{ child: "9", parent: "8", ant: "F3 t" },
		{ child: "4", parent: "9", display: "none" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "9", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

This takes care of the left node in the second generation, so now we
consider the right node. We dequeue our `queue`, assigning the dequeued
address to `p`:

```rust
Node root = newNode(5);
Queue queue = newQueue();
queue.enqueue(root);
Node* p = queue.dequeue();
Node* t = newNode(8);
(*p).left_child = t;
t = newNode(6);
queue.enqueue(t);
(*p).right_child = t;
p = queue.dequeue();
t = newNode(9);
(*p).right_child = t;
p = queue.dequeue();
```

Using `p`, again we ask, does `p` have a left child? Yes, it does. We
create a new node using `t`, enqueue `t`, and have `p`'s left-child pointer
point to `t`:

```rust
Node root = newNode(5);
Queue queue = newQueue();
queue.enqueue(root);
Node* p = queue.dequeue();
Node* t = newNode(8);
(*p).left_child = t;
t = newNode(6);
queue.enqueue(t);
(*p).right_child = t;
p = queue.dequeue();
t = newNode(9);
(*p).right_child = t;
p = queue.dequeue();
t = newNode(3);
queue.enqueue(t);
(*p).left_child = t;
```

<Queue
	data={[
		{ val: "F0", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "F1", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "F2", focus: "red", ant: "p" },
		{ val: "F3" },
		{ val: "F4", ant: "t" },
		{ val: "" },
	]}
	scale={50}
/>
<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "5", parent: "", ant: "F0" },
		{ child: "8", parent: "5", ant: "F1" },
		{ child: "6", parent: "5", ant: "F2 p" },
		{ child: "3", parent: "6", ant: "F4 t" },
		{ child: "", parent: "6", display: "none" },
		{ child: "", parent: "8", display: "none" },
		{ child: "9", parent: "8", ant: "F3" },
		{ child: "4", parent: "9", display: "none" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "9", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

We then ask, does `p` have a right-child? No, it does not. So we go to the
next generation:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "5", parent: "", ant: "F0", opacity: 0.2 },
		{ child: "8", parent: "5", ant: "F1", opacity: 0.2 },
		{ child: "6", parent: "5", ant: "F2 p", opacity: 0.2 },
		{ child: "3", parent: "6", opacity: 0.2, ant: "F4 t" },
		{ child: "", parent: "6", display: "none" },
		{ child: "", parent: "8", display: "none" },
		{ child: "9", parent: "8", opacity: 0.2, ant: "F3" },
		{ child: "4", parent: "9" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "9" },
	]}
/>

We `dequeue` our `queue`, and assign the returned address to `p`.

```rust
	Node root = newNode(5);
	Queue queue = newQueue();
	queue.enqueue(root);
	Node* p = queue.dequeue();
	Node* t = newNode(8);
	(*p).left_child = t;
	t = newNode(6);
	queue.enqueue(t);
	(*p).right_child = t;
	p = queue.dequeue();
	t = newNode(9);
	(*p).right_child = t;
	p = queue.dequeue();
	t = newNode(3);
	queue.enqueue(t);
	(*p).left_child = t;
	p = queue.dequeue(); `address in p: F3`
```

<Queue
	data={[
		{ val: "F0", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "F1", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "F2", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "F3", focus: "red", ant: "p" },
		{ val: "F4", ant: "t" },
		{ val: "" },
	]}
	scale={50}
/>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "5", parent: "", ant: "F0" },
		{ child: "8", parent: "5", ant: "F1" },
		{ child: "6", parent: "5", ant: "F2" },
		{ child: "3", parent: "6", ant: "F4 t" },
		{ child: "", parent: "6", display: "none" },
		{ child: "", parent: "8", display: "none" },
		{ child: "9", parent: "8", ant: "F3 p" },
		{ child: "4", parent: "9", display: "none" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "9", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

We ask: Does the node `p` have a left child? Yes, it does. We create a new
node using `t`, queue `t`, and assign `t` to the `left_child` pointer of
`p`:

```rust
	Node root = newNode(5);
	Queue queue = newQueue();
	queue.enqueue(root);
	Node* p = queue.dequeue();
	Node* t = newNode(8);
	(*p).left_child = t;
	t = newNode(6);
	queue.enqueue(t);
	(*p).right_child = t;
	p = queue.dequeue();
	t = newNode(9);
	(*p).right_child = t;
	p = queue.dequeue();
	t = newNode(3);
	queue.enqueue(t);
	(*p).left_child = t;
	p = queue.dequeue(); `address in p: F3`
	t = newNode(4); `address: F5`
	queue.enqueue(t);
	(*p).left_child = t;
```

<Queue
	data={[
		{ val: "F0", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "F1", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "F2", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "F3", focus: "red", ant: "p" },
		{ val: "F4" },
		{ val: "F5", ant: "t" },
	]}
	scale={50}
/>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "5", parent: "", ant: "F0" },
		{ child: "8", parent: "5", ant: "F1" },
		{ child: "6", parent: "5", ant: "F2" },
		{ child: "3", parent: "6", ant: "F4" },
		{ child: "", parent: "6", display: "none" },
		{ child: "", parent: "8", display: "none" },
		{ child: "9", parent: "8", ant: "F3 p" },
		{ child: "4", parent: "9", ant: "F5 t" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "9", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

Then we ask: Does the node `p` have a right child? Yes. Again we create a
new node using `t`, queue `t`, and assign `t` to the `right_child` pointer
of `p`:

```rust
	Node root = newNode(5);
	Queue queue = newQueue();
	queue.enqueue(root);
	Node* p = queue.dequeue();
	Node* t = newNode(8);
	(*p).left_child = t;
	t = newNode(6);
	queue.enqueue(t);
	(*p).right_child = t;
	p = queue.dequeue();
	t = newNode(9);
	(*p).right_child = t;
	p = queue.dequeue();
	t = newNode(3);
	queue.enqueue(t);
	(*p).left_child = t;
	p = queue.dequeue(); `address in p: F3`
	t = newNode(4); `address: F5`
	queue.enqueue(t);
	(*p).left_child = t;
	t = newNode(2); `address: F6`
	(*p).right_child = t;
```

<Queue
	data={[
		{ val: "F0", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "F1", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "F2", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "F3", focus: "red", ant: "p" },
		{ val: "F4" },
		{ val: "F5" },
		{ val: "F6", ant: "t" },
	]}
	scale={50}
/>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "5", parent: "", ant: "F0" },
		{ child: "8", parent: "5", ant: "F1" },
		{ child: "6", parent: "5", ant: "F2" },
		{ child: "3", parent: "6", ant: "F4" },
		{ child: "", parent: "6", display: "none" },
		{ child: "", parent: "8", display: "none" },
		{ child: "9", parent: "8", ant: "F3 p" },
		{ child: "4", parent: "9", ant: "F5" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "9", ant: "F6 t" },
	]}
/>

At this point, we see that we've generated our tree. The algorithm
continues by dequeuing the remaining queuers, testing for the two
conditions of left- and right-child existence. Once the last queuer is
dequeued, the algorithm terminates.

dequeued, the algorithm terminates.

## C Implementation

Below is an implementation in C. This is somewhat of a lengthy
implementation because we need an auxiliary data structure, the circular
queue.

First, we start with a diagram of the tree we want to construct. In this
case, we'll use the following tree for illustration:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "3", parent: "" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "3" },
		{ child: "1", parent: "3" },
		{ child: "7", parent: "2" },
		{ child: "4", parent: "2" },
		{ child: "8", parent: "1" },
		{ child: "", parent: "1", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

Next, the program we'll run is written in a file called `Main.c`. Its
source code and output appear as such:

```c
#include "Tree.h"

int main() {
	struct Tree* tree = newTree();
	printTree(tree);
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
$ make Main
cc     Main.c   -o Main
$ ./Main
Enter root value: 3
Enter left child of 3: 1
Enter right child of 3: 2
Enter left child of 1: 8
Enter right child of 1: 7
Enter left child of 2: -1
Enter right child of 2: 4
Enter left child of 8: -1
Enter right child of 8: -1
Enter left child of 3: -1
Enter right child of 3: -1
3
|---2
|   |---4
|---1
|   |---8
|   |---7
```

In the code above, we use a function called `newTree()`, which takes no
parameters. When `Main.c` is run, the user is prompted to enter the
different values to be placed in each node. To keep the code simple, we'll
use the value `-1` to indicate that a particular node does not exist.
Entering `-1` for all leaves in the tree terminates the tree construction,
which brings us to the next line, `printTree(tree)`. This function prints
the newly constructed tree.

Now that we know how the overall program works, let's examine the
implementation details. First, we have an include: `#include "Tree.h"`.
Let's look inside this header file.

Inside the `Tree.h` header file, we have the following code:

```c
#include "Queue.h"

struct Node {
	int data;
	struct Node* left_child;
	struct Node* right_child;
};

struct Node* newNode(int datum) {
	struct Node* node = (struct Node*) malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
	(*node).data = datum;
	(*node).left_child = NULL;
	(*node).right_child = NULL;
	return node;
}

struct Tree {
	struct Node* root;
};

struct Tree* newTree() {
	struct Tree* tree = (struct Tree*) malloc(sizeof(struct Tree));
	(*tree).root = NULL;
	struct Node *p, *t;
	int user_input_data;
	struct Queue* pointerQueue = newQueue(10);
	printf("Enter root value: ");
	scanf("%d", &user_input_data);
	(*tree).root = newNode(user_input_data);
	enqueue(pointerQueue, (*tree).root);

	while(!isEmpty(pointerQueue)) {
		p = dequeue(pointerQueue);
		printf("Enter left child of %d: ", (*p).data);
		scanf("%d", &user_input_data);
		if (user_input_data != -1) {
			t = newNode(user_input_data);
			(*p).left_child = t;
			enqueue(pointerQueue, t);
		}
		printf("Enter right child of %d: ", (*p).data);
		scanf("%d", &user_input_data);
		if (user_input_data != -1) {
			t = newNode(user_input_data);
			(*p).right_child = t;
			enqueue(pointerQueue, t);
		}
	}
	return tree;
}

void print(struct Node* tree, int level) {
	if (tree != NULL) {
		for (int i = 0; i < level; i++) {
			printf(i == level - 1 ? "|---" : "|   ");
		}
		printf("%d\n", (*tree).data);
		print((*tree).right_child, level + 1);
		print((*tree).left_child, level + 1);
	}
}

void printTree(struct Tree* tree) {
	print((*tree).root, 0);
}
```

The `queue.h` file contains the following code:

```c
#pragma once
#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct Queue {
	int capacity;
	int length;
	int front;
	int rear;
	struct Node** Q;
};

struct Queue* newQueue(int maxSize) {
	struct Queue* queue = (struct Queue*) malloc(sizeof(struct Queue));
	(*queue).capacity = maxSize;
	(*queue).length = 0;
	(*queue).front = -1;
	(*queue).rear = -1;
	(*queue).Q = (struct Node**) malloc(sizeof(int) * maxSize);
	return queue;
}

bool isFull(struct Queue* queue) {
	int rear = (*queue).rear + 1;
	int front = (*queue).front;
	int max = (*queue).capacity;
	return rear % max == front;
}

bool isEmpty(struct Queue* queue) {
	return (*queue).front == (*queue).rear;
}

void enqueue(struct Queue* queue, struct Node* data) {
	if (isFull(queue)) {
		printf("Queue is full; enqueue prohibited.\n");
	} else {
		(*queue).rear = ((*queue).rear + 1) % (*queue).capacity;
		(*queue).Q[(*queue).rear] = data;
	}
}

struct Node* dequeue(struct Queue* queue) {
	struct Node* t = NULL;
	if (isEmpty(queue)) {
		printf("Queue is empty, dequeue prohibited. Returning null pointer.\n");
	} else {
		(*queue).front = ((*queue).front + 1) % ((*queue).capacity);
		t = (*queue).Q[(*queue).front];
	}
	return t;
}

void printQueue(struct Queue* queue) {
	for (int i = 0; i < (*queue).capacity; i++) {
		printf("%p ", (*queue).Q[i]);
		printf("\n");
	}
}
```

Let's go over this code carefully, focusing on `Tree.h`. First, we have the
definition for a `Node` struct:

```c
struct Node {
	int data;
	struct Node* left_child;
	struct Node* right_child;
};
```

This is a tree node. It has a data field, `data`, which is bound to the
value the node stores. The node also has a `left_child` pointer, which
points to the node's left child, itself a node, and a `right_child`
pointer, which points to the node's right child.

Next, we have a _node constructor_. This is similar to the singly-linked
list's node constructor &mdash; a function that creates a new instance of a
node.

```c
struct Node* newNode(int datum) {
	struct Node* node = (struct Node*) malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
	(*node).data = datum;
	(*node).left_child = NULL;
	(*node).right_child = NULL;
	return node;
}
```

The node constructor `newNode()` has the parameter `int datum`. We pass the
data we want stored in the resulting tree node into `newNode()` as an
argument, which is bound to `int datum`. Inside `newNode()`, we allocate
enough space for a `Node` struct, followed by an instantiation of the new
node's fields. In this case, `datum` is bound to the new node's `data`
field, and the `left_child` and `right_child` pointers are initialized to
`NULL`. Once initialized, we return the newly instantiated node.

Next, we have the definition for a `Tree` struct.

```c
struct Tree {
	struct Node* root;
};
```

For now, this structure only has a single field, the `root`. This is a
`Node` pointer, which serves as our access point for the rest of the tree.
In later sections, we will add further properties to the `Tree` structure
(e.g., depth, height, levels, etc.), as well as more elaborate methods that
utilize these additional properties.

Following the tree structure, we have the _tree constructor_:

```c
struct Tree* newTree() {
	struct Tree* tree = (struct Tree*) malloc(sizeof(struct Tree));
	(*tree).root = NULL;
	struct Node *p, *t;
	int user_input_data;
	struct Queue* pointerQueue = newQueue(10);
	printf("Enter root value: ");
	scanf("%d", &user_input_data);
	(*tree).root = newNode(user_input_data);
	enqueue(pointerQueue, (*tree).root);

	while(!isEmpty(pointerQueue)) {
		p = dequeue(pointerQueue);

		printf("Enter left child of %d: ", (*p).data);
		scanf("%d", &user_input_data);
		if (user_input_data != -1) {
			t = newNode(user_input_data);
			(*p).left_child = t;
			enqueue(pointerQueue, t);
		}

		printf("Enter right child of %d: ", (*p).data);
		scanf("%d", &user_input_data);
		if (user_input_data != -1) {
			t = newNode(user_input_data);
			(*p).right_child = t;
			enqueue(pointerQueue, t);
		}
	}
	return tree;
}
```

This is a fairly large function, so we'll take it a piece at a time. First,
we create a new instace of a tree, with its `root` pointer initially
`NULL`:

```c
struct Tree* tree = (struct Tree*) malloc(sizeof(struct Tree));
(*tree).root = NULL;
```

Next, we create two `Node` pointers, `p` and `t`.

```c
struct Node *p, *t;
```

The pointer `p` is used to point to the current node we want to test for
child existence. The pointer `t` is then used to create new node instances.

After these two pointers, we have the _pointer queue_:

```c
struct Queue* pointerQueue = newQueue(10);
```

This is a circular queue with a circumference of ${10:}$

<CircularQueue
	data={["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}
	name="address-circular-queue"
	scale={50}
/>

We use this queue to keep track of the values of `p` and `t`. The auxiliary
circular queue's implementation will be discussed shortly in the Queue.h
section.

Following these pointers, we have a variable `user_input_data`, followed by
a prompt for user input:

```c
int user_input_data;
printf("Enter root value: ");
```

The variable `user_input_data` stores the user's input passed to the
`scanf` call:

```c
scanf("%d", &user_input_data);
```

When the user inputs a value, that value is bound to `user_input_data`.
With `user_input_data` initialized, it is then passed as an argument to
`newNode()`:

```c
(*tree).root = newNode(user_input_data);
```

This results in a new tree node, following the `newNode()` constructor's
implementation.

```pseudo
*node = {
	data = user_input_data;
	left_child = NULL;
	right_child = NULL;
}
```

The `tree` we initialized earlier, whose pointer `root` was initially
`NULL`, now points to the address of this new node:

```pseudo
(*tree).root = {
	data = user_input_data;
	left_child = NULL;
	right_child = NULL;
}
```

Suppose the address of `root` is `0x1`. We enqueue this address into our
circular queue, `pointerQueue`:

```c
	enqueue(pointerQueue, (*tree).root);
```

<CircularQueue
	data={["0x1", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}
	name="address-circular-queue"
	scale={50}
/>

All of this code establishes the tree's `root`. Once the root's
established, we can begin inserting the root's descendants. To do so, we
use a while-loop. The guard clause for the while loop: As long as the the
pointer queue isn't empty.

```c
while(!isEmpty(pointerQueue)) {
	p = dequeue(pointerQueue);

	printf("Enter left child of %d: ", (*p).data);
	scanf("%d", &user_input_data);
	if (user_input_data != -1) {
		t = newNode(user_input_data);
		(*p).left_child = t;
		enqueue(pointerQueue, t);
	}

	printf("Enter right child of %d: ", (*p).data);
	scanf("%d", &user_input_data);
	if (user_input_data != -1) {
		t = newNode(user_input_data);
		(*p).right_child = t;
		enqueue(pointerQueue, t);
	}
}
```

If the pointer queue is not empty, we enter the while-loop. Inside, we
first assign to `p` the return value of dequeuing `pointerQueue`.

```c
p = dequeue(pointerQueue);
```

The `dequeue()` function, found in `queue.h`, accesses the current front
queuer of a queue, dequeues and returns that queuer as an output value.
That output value, a node pointer, is then bound to `p`.

Once dequeued, we proceed to the while-loop's two prongs:

```c
	printf("Enter left child of %d: ", (*p).data);
	scanf("%d", &user_input_data);
	if (user_input_data != -1) {
		t = newNode(user_input_data);
		(*p).left_child = t;
		enqueue(pointerQueue, t);
	}
```

```c
	printf("Enter right child of %d: ", (*p).data);
	scanf("%d", &user_input_data);
	if (user_input_data != -1) {
		t = newNode(user_input_data);
		(*p).right_child = t;
		enqueue(pointerQueue, t);
	}
```

For both of these prongs, we prompt the user to enter the left- and
right-child values for `p` respectively. The `(*p).data` is used to inform
the user which node the user is entering data for. When the user enters the
data, she has the choice to enter either `-1` or any other `int` value. If
the user enters `-1`, we enter the relevant if-block and create a new node.
For example, suppose the user enters `2` for the `root`'s left-child. The
code block to execute:

```c
t = newNode(user_input_data);
(*p).left_child = t;
enqueue(pointerQueue, t);
```

In the first line, we create a new node:

```c
	t = newNode(user_input_data);
```

```pseudo
	*t = {
		data = 2;
		left_child = NULL;
		right_child = NULL;
	}
```

Let's say the address of this new node is `0x2`. Once the new node is
created, we make the left-child of `p`, currently the `root`, point to this
new node:

```rust
*p = {
	data = 3;
	left_child = t;
	right_child = NULL;
}
```

Then we enqueue this address to the `pointerQueue`:

```c
	enqueue(pointerQueue, t);
```

<CircularQueue
	data={["0x1", "0x2", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}
	name="address-circular-queue"
	scale={50}
/>

Next, we prompt the user to enter the right-child of `p` (still currently
the root). The user enters `1`. Using `t`, we create a new node with, say,
an address of `0x3`.

```rust
0x2 = {
	data = 1;
	left_child = NULL;
	right_child = NULL;
}
*t = {
	data = 1;
	left_child = NULL;
	right_child = NULL;
}
*p = {
	data = 3;
	left_child = 0x2;
	right_child = t;
}
```

We again enqueue the current address `t` points to into `pointerQueue`:

```c
	enqueue(pointerQueue, t);
```

<CircularQueue
	data={["0x1", "0x2", "0x3", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}
	name="address-circular-queue"
	scale={50}
/>

Once the left- and right-children of the current `p` are taken care of, we
move back to the top of the while-loop:

```c
p = dequeue(pointerQueue);
```

Dequeuing `pointerQueue`, `p` now becomes the new front queuer:

<CircularQueue
	data={["", "0x2", "0x3", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}
	name="address-circular-queue"
	scale={50}
/>

This process continues until the queue is completely empty.
