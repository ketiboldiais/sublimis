# Traversal Generation

In this section, we examine different ways of generating trees. Since we've
just gone over traversals, we begin by considering how we might generate a
tree using the traversal methods.

The idea behind traversal generation can be thought of as "working
backwards:" If we're given traversal sequences, we can generate the tree
that results in those sequences. Note the plural &mdash; traversal
sequences . This is a key point, because with just a single traversal
sequence, we do not have enough data to generate a tree. For example,
suppose we're told that the following is a preorder traversal sequence of
the tree's node values:

<Sequence data={["A", "B", "C"]} scale={30}/>

Without further information, we cannot construct a tree because the
traversal sequence above could have come from five possible trees:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "A", parent: "" },
		{ child: "B", parent: "A" },
		{ child: "C", parent: "A" },
	]}
/>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "A", parent: "" },
		{ child: "B", parent: "A" },
		{ child: "E", parent: "A", display: "none" },
		{ child: "C", parent: "B" },
		{ child: "F", parent: "B", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "A", parent: "" },
		{ child: "B", parent: "A" },
		{ child: "E", parent: "A", display: "none" },
		{ child: "F", parent: "B", display: "none" },
		{ child: "C", parent: "B" },
	]}
/>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "A", parent: "" },
		{ child: "E", parent: "A", display: "none" },
		{ child: "B", parent: "A" },
		{ child: "C", parent: "B" },
		{ child: "F", parent: "B", display: "none" },
	]}
/>

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "A", parent: "" },
		{ child: "E", parent: "A", display: "none" },
		{ child: "B", parent: "A" },
		{ child: "F", parent: "B", display: "none" },
		{ child: "C", parent: "B" },
	]}
/>

Accordingly, preorder, inorder, and postorder sequences alone are
insufficient. We need additional sequences. Specifically, we need one of
the following combinations of data:

1. The preorder sequence and inorder sequence, or
2. the postorder sequence and inorder sequence.

Notice that in both cases, we need the inorder sequence. To see why we need
the inorder sequence, let's just go straight to the algorithm with an
example.

First, we're given two sequences. A preorder traversal sequence:

<Sequence data={[4, 7, 9, 6, 3, 2, 5, 8, 1]} />

and an inorder traversal sequence:

<Sequence data={[7, 6, 8, 3, 4, 5, 8, 2, 1]} />

From the preorder sequence, we know that the node containing `4` is the
root. Thus, the tree's root is a node containing `4`. Then, from the
inorder sequence of the tree, we know that all the values to the left of
`4` form the left-subtree, and all the values to the right of `4` form the
right-subtree. Thus, we have:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "4", parent: "" },
		{ child: "7,6,9,3", parent: "4", noCircle: true },
		{ child: "5,8,2,1", parent: "4", noCircle: true },
	]}
	height={80}
/>

The rest of the algorithm follows this basic step. We continue splitting
until there's nothing left to split. So, we look at the next element in the
preorder sequence and see that it's `7`. This tells us that the node
containing `7` is the root of the left-subtree.

We go to the inorder sequence and look for `7`, and find that it's the
first element. Inorder sequence then tells us that everything to the left
of `7` forms its left-subtree, and everything to the right forms the
right-subtree. Thus, we have:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "4", parent: "" },
		{ child: "7", parent: "4" },
		{ child: "5,8,2,1", parent: "4", noCircle: true },
		{ child: "6,9,3", parent: "7", noCircle: true, display: "none" },
		{ child: "6,9,3", parent: "7", noCircle: true },
	]}
	height={80}
/>

The algorithm continues. We go to the next element, and see that it's `9`.
We go to the inorder sequence, look for `9`, and divide accordingly:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "4", parent: "" },
		{ child: "7", parent: "4" },
		{ child: "5,8,2,1", parent: "4", noCircle: true },
		{ child: "12", parent: "7", noCircle: true, display: "none" },
		{ child: "9", parent: "7" },
		{ child: "6", parent: "9" },
		{ child: "3", parent: "9" },
	]}
	edgeLength={100}
/>

We then move to the next element in the preorder sequence, `6`. Here, we
see that it's a single element &mdash; there's nothing to its left or
right. The same goes for `3`. So we go the next element, `2`. Again we
search for `2` in the inorder sequence, and find that it has `5` and `8` to
its left, and `1` to its right:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "4", parent: "" },
		{ child: "7", parent: "4" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "4" },
		{ child: "12", parent: "7", noCircle: true, display: "none" },
		{ child: "9", parent: "7" },
		{ child: "6", parent: "9" },
		{ child: "3", parent: "9" },
		{ child: "5,8", parent: "2", noCircle: true },
		{ child: "1", parent: "2", noCircle: true },
	]}
	edgeLength={100}
/>

At this point, the algorithm should be clear. Executing the rest of the
algorithm, we get:

<Tree
	data={[
		{ child: "4", parent: "" },
		{ child: "7", parent: "4" },
		{ child: "2", parent: "4" },
		{ child: "12", parent: "7", display: "none" },
		{ child: "9", parent: "7" },
		{ child: "6", parent: "9" },
		{ child: "3", parent: "9" },
		{ child: "5", parent: "2" },
		{ child: "17", parent: "5", display: "none" },
		{ child: "8", parent: "5" },
		{ child: "1", parent: "2" },
	]}
	edgeLength={100}
/>
