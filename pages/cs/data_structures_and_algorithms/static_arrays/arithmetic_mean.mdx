# Arithmetic Mean

A useful operator to have when working with arrays is returning the
_arithmetic mean_. This is done with the `ArithmeticMean()` operator. The
implementation is straightforward. We simply compute the sum of all the
elements, and divide it by the number of elements.

```rust
average():
	total = 0;
	for (i = 0; i < length; i++):
		total += array[i]
	return total / length
```

As we can see, the time complexity is no different, save for the extra
operation in the last line of dividing by the length. Accordingly, this
approach has a time complexity of ${O(n)}$â€”linear time.
