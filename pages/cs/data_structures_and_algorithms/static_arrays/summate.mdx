# Summing Elements

The `sum()` operator will return the sum of all the elements in the array.
Summing the elements of an array requires traversing the entire element,
adding each element to some variable ${t}$ representing the sum. In
pseudocode:

```rust
sum():
	total = 0;
	for (i = 0; i < length; i++):
		total += array[i]
	return total
```

From the operation count above, we see that this approach has a running
time function of ${f(n) = 2n + 3.}$ Accordingly, this algorithm has a time
complexity of ${O(n),}$ which is linear time.

Alternatively, we can apply a recursive implementation:

```rust
sum(array):
	if (array.length - 1 > 0):
		return 0;
	else:
		return sum(A, array.length - 1) + A[array.length]
```

The recursive implementation also has a time complexity of ${O(n).}$ The
difference, however, is that each recursive call will result in a new stack
generation, leading to a space complexity of ${O(n).}$ This is in contrast
to the iterative approach, which has a space complexity of ${O(1).}$
