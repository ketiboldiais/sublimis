# Function Returns

Just as functions can take different parameters, functions can also have
different returns. The default return method is _return-by-value_. The
function performs a computation, and returns the result. We can, however,
also perform _return-by-address_ and _return-by-reference_.

## Return-by-address

Suppose we wanted a function to return an array, which we can then use and
mutate elsewhere. One way to do so is to write a function with
**return-by-address** &mdash; a function that returns the address of stored
data:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int* natNumArray(int size) {
	int *p = new int[size];
	for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
		p[i] = i+1;
	}
	return p;
}

int main() {
	int *natNumPTR = natNumArray(5);
	return 0;
}
```

In the code above, we allocated memory in the heap for an `int` array,
using the function `natNumArray()`. The function returns the resulting
array's address, and in `main()`, that address is assigned to a pointer
called `*natNumPTR`. As a result, both `p` in `natNumArray()` and
`natNumPTR` point to the same address, effectively allowing us to modify
the newly allocated array.

## Return-by-reference

With return-by-address, we use an explicit pointer. We can instead use an
implicit pointer with **return-by-reference**. By writing a function as
return-by-reference, we instruct C++ that the particular reference returns
a pointer to its return value, rather than the value itself. The end
result: We can use functions on the left side of an assignment statement,
rather than the typical right side.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

double& setValues(double vals[], int i) {
	return vals[i];
}

int main () {
	double arr[] = {1.1, 9.8, 3.1, 2.1, 5.7};
	cout << "Value before change" << endl;
	for ( int i = 0; i < 5; i++ ) {
		cout << "\t arr[" << i << "] = ";
		cout << arr[i] << endl;
	}

	setValues(arr, 1) = 19.2;
	setValues(arr, 3) = 58.8;

	cout << "Value after change" << endl;
	for ( int i = 0; i < 5; i++ ) {
		cout << "\t arr[" << i << "] = ";
		cout << arr[i] << endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
Value before change
	arr[0] = 1.1
	arr[1] = 9.8
	arr[2] = 3.1
	arr[3] = 2.1
	arr[4] = 5.7
Value after change
	arr[0] = 1.1
	arr[1] = 19.2
	arr[2] = 3.1
	arr[3] = 58.8
	arr[4] = 5.7
```
