# Libraries

A **library** is just a special word for a source code file that groups, or
gathers, related operations. We can think of it as a package containing
snippets of code that make our main driver (the source code file containing
the brunt of our program) easier to produce, test, maintain, and ship.

A C++ library consists of two parts: (1) a **header file**, and (2) an
**implementation file**. The header file—denoted by the extension
`.h`—provides all of the function prototypes (e.g., names and types) and
usage comments. The implementation file, denoted by the extension
`.cpp`—implements everything in the header file.

Libraries are a means of modularization—they break down and separate source
code into smaller pieces. For example, consider the following program:

For example, consider the following program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

double absolute_value(double n) {
	if (n < 0.0) {
		return -1.0 * n;
	} else if (n > 0.0) {
		return n;
	} else {
		return 0;
	}
};

double square(double n) {
	return n * n;
};

double sqrt(double n) {
	const double EPSILON = 0.001;
	double lower, upper, guess;
	if (n < 1) {
		lower = n;
		upper = 1;
	} else {
		lower = 1;
		upper = n;
	}
	while ((upper - lower) > EPSILON) {
		guess = (lower + upper) / 2;
		if (square(guess) > n) {
			upper = guess;
		} else {
			lower = guess;
		}
	}
	return (lower + upper) / 2;
};

int main() {
	double a = 4.0;
	double b = square(a);
	double c = sqrt(a);
	cout << "The number is: " << a << endl;
	cout << "It's square is: " << b << endl;
	cout << "It's square root is: " << c << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

In the program above, we have three functions, `absolute_value()`,
`square()`, and `square_root()`. The main driver, indicated by the function
`main()`, is fairly simple. It just computes and outputs the square and
square root of `4.0`. But just look at the size of this thing. It's huge,
for a relatively simple computation. What we instead should do is "package"
the functions `absolute_value()`, `square()`, and `square_root()` into a
library.

The first step is to write all of the function prototypes inside a header
file. Following best practice, that file should be the name of our library.
Let's call it `maths.h`:

```cpp
// maths.h
double absolute_value(double n);
double square(double n);
double sqrt(double n);
```

Notice `maths.h` only contains the function protoypes. This is intentional.
A header file represents the **interface**. It should only inform the user
what the function does; implementation details shouldn't be presented.

Second step: Implement the functions. All the details surrounding the
interface's implementation (i.e., how the functions in the header file are
implemented) are placed in a separate source code file. Again following
best practice, that source code file should have the same name as the
header file it implements. Thus, we'll call it `maths.cpp`:

```cpp
// maths.cpp
#include "maths.h"

double absolute_value(double n) {
	if (n < 0.0) {
		return -1.0 * n;
	} else if (n > 0.0) {
		return n;
	} else {
		return 0;
	}
};

double square(double n) {
	return n * n;
};

double sqrt(double n) {
	const double EPSILON = 0.001;
	double lower, upper, guess;
	if (n < 1) {
		lower = n;
		upper = 1;
	} else {
		lower = 1;
		upper = n;
	}
	while ((upper - lower) > EPSILON) {
		guess = (lower + upper) / 2;
		if (square(guess) > n) {
			upper = guess;
		} else {
			lower = guess;
		}
	}
	return (lower + upper) / 2;
};
```

Notice the `#include maths.h`. This is what effectively tells C++ that
`maths.cpp` implements `math.h`.

Third step: We include the header file, `maths.h`, inside the main driver
(a file named `main.cpp`):

```cpp
// main.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "maths.h"
using namespace std;

int main() {
	double a = 4.0;
	double b = square(a);
	double c = sqrt(a);
	cout << "The number is: " << a << endl;
	cout << "It's square is: " << b << endl;
	cout << "It's square root is: " << c << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

Notice the `#include "maths.h"`. This effectively dumps all of the contents
of `maths.h` into the `main.cpp`. Our main driver is now much, much shorter
and cleaner.

Now, to run this code, we'll need to compile `main.cpp` and `maths.cpp`,
then link their resulting executables into a single executable.

```bash
g++ -c maths.cpp
g++ -c main.cpp
g++ -o mainProgram main.o maths.o
./mainProgram

The number is: 4
It's square is: 16
It's square root is: 2.00012
```

We can make the entire compilation and linking process above easier by
writing a `Makefile`. To do so, we simply create a new file called
`Makefile` inside our directory, and write the following code inside:

```bash
CC = g++
CFLAGS = -Wall -g
objects = main.o maths.o
all: $(objects)
clean:
	$(RM) *.o all
main: $(objects)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o mainProgram $(objects)
```

This leads to a much faster and easier compilation and linking process:

```bash
make
make main
./mainProgram

The number is: 4
It's square is: 16
It's square root is: 2.00012
```

Whenever we write `#include ${f}$`, where ${f}$ is some library, in our
source code file, the underlying process is essentially what's seen above.
The contents of ${f}$ are dumped into the source code file, where they are
used and treated as if we wrote them directly into the source code file.
