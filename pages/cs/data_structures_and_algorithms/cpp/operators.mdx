# Basic Operators in C++

C++ comes with several basic operators.[^operator] Below is a table briefly
presenting them. The last few rows following an `#include` are operators
(functions) that come from library. They only work if the library is
included (e.g., `#include <cmath>`).

[^operator]:
    An operator is a symbol that takes one or more values as inputs, and
    outputs another value after performing a particular operation. The
    values we pass as inputs are called the operands.

| operator    | description                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| `a + b`     | addition                         |
| `a - b`     | subtraction                      |
| `a * b`     | multiplication                   |
| `a / b`     | division                         |
| `a mod b`   | modulus                          |
| `a++`       | increment by 1                   |
| `a--`       | decrement by 1                   |
| `a & &b`    | logical AND                      |
| `a \|\| b`  | logical OR                       |
| `!a`        | logical not                      |
| `a == b`    | `a` equal to `b`?                |
| `a != b`    | `a` not equal to `b`?            |
| `a < b`     | `a` less than `b`?               |
| `a > b`     | `a` greater than `b`?            |
| `a <= b`    | `a greater than or equal to `b`? |
| `a >= b`    | `a greater than or equal to `b`? |
| `a ? b : c` | If `a`, then `b`, otherwise `c`  |

Operators fall into three categories: **Unary operators** are operators
that take just one value as input. For example, the increment operator,
`++`, increments by 1, and takes just one value as input. **Binary
operators** are operators that take exactly two values as inputs. For
example, the division operator `\` is a binary operator, since it takes two
values. **Ternary operators** are operators that take exactly three values
as inputs. In C++, the ternary operator `?:` is an operator takes three
expressions as inputs and outputs one expression. For example:

```cpp
	#include <iostream>
	using namespace std;

	int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
		int x = 1;
		int y = 2;
		int z = 3;
		int w;
		x == 1 ? w = y : w = z;
		cout << "w = " << w << endl;
	}
```

```bash
w = 2
```

The ternary operator `x == 1 ? w = y : w = z;` says, if `x` is equal to
`1`, then `w = y`. Otherwise, `w = z`. Since `x == 1` is true, `w = y`.
Thus, `w = 2`.
