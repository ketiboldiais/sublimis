# Preprocessing

C++ uses a **preprocessor** to process source code before the code goes to
the compiler. The preprocessor performs several tasks. First, it goes
through the entire source code, and replaces every comment with a single
space. Then, it looks for **preprocessor directives** and executes them.
These directives always start with a hash sign, `#`. Some examples:

- `#include &lt;iostream&gt;`
- `#include "foo.h"`
- `#if`
- `#else`
- `#endif`
- `#ifdef`
- `#ifndef`
- `#define`
- `#undef`
- `#line`
- `#error`
- `#pragma`

The most commonly used directive is `#include`. When the preprocessor
encounters this directive, it replaces the line with the file referred to
(the preprocessor processes that file as well). Once the directive is
processed, it is removed.

We can think of `#include` as akin to importing libraries or modules in
other languages. When we write `#include `${\alpha}$`` into a source code
file ${\beta}$, C++ essentially dumps, or pastes, all of the contents of
${\alpha}$ into file ${\beta.}$

## Header Files and Preprocessing

Let's forget about the notion of libraries for a moment, and just talk
about header files. The basic idea behind a header file is what forms the
basis for libraries. As aforementioned, by convention, we indicate header
files with a `.h` extension. E.g., `foo.h`.

To begin, we start by considering the following code, contained in a file
called `print.cpp`:

```cpp
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
	char message[] = "Hello world!";
	std::cout << message << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
Hello world!
```

All we're doing is outputting to the console the contents of `message`.
Let's say we don't want to keep writing the line containing `std::cout` and
`std::endl`, so we write a `print()` function:

```cpp
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void printString(const char* message) {
	std::cout << message << std::endl;
}

int main() {
	char message[] = "Hello world!";
	printString(message);
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
"Hello world!";
```

Now let's say we have another file, `ErrorMessages.cpp`, that prints custom
error messages. Let's further say that we want to use our `printString()`
function; it's pretty useful after all:

```cpp
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void end_of_file_reached() {
	printString("End of the file reached during read.");
}

void negative_integer() {
	printString("Negative integer detected. Only positive integers permitted.");
}

void float_detected() {
	printString("Floating point number detected. Only integers permitted.");
}
```

The problem with our `ErrorMessages.cpp` file: The compiler has no idea
what `printString()` is. In fact, `printString()` just doesn't exist. We
need a way to tell the compiler that `printString()` actually exists. To do
so, we must write a function declaration (i.e., a function without its
body):

```cpp
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void printString(const char* message);

void end_of_file_reached() {
	printString("End of the file reached during read.");
}

void negative_integer() {
	printString("Negative integer detected. Only positive integers permitted.");
}

void float_detected() {
	printString("Floating point number detected. Only integers permitted.");
}
```

The code above compiles just fine. But notice what this means. Do we have
to write these function declarations in all of our files? The answer is,
frankly, yes. We have to include the relevant function declarations
everywhere. As we can surmise, this is tedious. We just have one function
above, but with larger programs, we could easily have hundreds, if not
thousands, of functions. This is where header files come to the rescue.

What we can do is create a new file called `print.h`, and place therein our
function declaration:

```cpp
// print.h
#pragma once

void printString(const char* message);
```

We'll talk about `#pragma once` in a moment. For now, the key point is that
we're placing our function `printString()` declaration inside the header
file. Then, inside `ErrorMessages.cpp`, we include the header file:

```cpp
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include "print.h"


void end_of_file_reached() {
	printString("End of the file reached during read.");
}

void negative_integer() {
	printString("Negative integer detected. Only positive integers permitted.");
}

void float_detected() {
	printString("Floating point number detected. Only integers permitted.");
}
```

Our code compiles just fine. Now, inside `print.cpp`, the `main()` function
was included for demonstration purposes. `print.cpp` isn't our main driver.
Instead, `main()` should be placed in a `Main.cpp` file. Accordingly, let's
place `main()` inside a new file `main.cpp` with some code:

```cpp
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include "print.h"

int main() {
	printString("Hello world!");
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
Hello world!
```

This works as expected. Next, we can transfer our function declarations in
`ErrorMessages.cpp` into a header file of its own:

```cpp
#include "print.h"

void end_of_file_reached();
void negative_integer();
void float_detected();
```

Then, placing `ErrorMessages.h` into our `main.cpp` file:

```cpp
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include "print.h"
#include "ErrorMessages.h"

int main() {
	end_of_file_reached();
	negative_integer();
	float_detected();
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
End of the file reached during read.
Negative integer detected. Only positive integers permitted.
Floating point number detected. Only integers permitted.
```

It works as expected. Let's go back to that `#pragma once` statement.
`#pragma once` is a preprocessor, and it's essentially a safeguard. To see
why we need `#pragma once`, suppose `print.h` contained a `struct` called
`CustomMessages`, and we removed `#pragma once`:

```cpp
void printString(const char* message);

struct CommonMessages {};
```

If we tried to compile our program again:

```bash
make all

./print.h:3:8: error: redefinition of 'CommonMessages'
struct CommonMessages {};
			^
main.cpp:2:10: note: './print.h' included multiple times, additional include site here
#include "print.h"
				^
./ErrorMessages.h:1:10: note: './print.h' included multiple times, additional include site here
#include "print.h"
				^
./print.h:3:8: note: unguarded header; consider using #ifdef guards or #pragma once
struct CommonMessages {};
			^
1 error generated.
make: *** [main.o] Error 1
```

We get an error message that we're redefining `CommonMessages`. Why is this
happening? Well, recall what `#include` does. It essentially tells the
preprocessor to "copy-and-paste" contents of a file into the file. Thus, by
omitting `#pragma once`, we have `struct CommonMessages {};` inside
`print.cpp`, then `struct CommonMessages {};` in `ErrorMessages.cpp`. When
we include `print.h` and `ErrorMessages.h` inside `main.cpp`, we have two
`struct CommonMessages {}` inside the same file. This violates C++'s rule
prohibiting redefinitions. `#pragma once` ensures that this duplication
doesn't happen. It essentially tells the preprocessor, "Only include this
once."

Including `#pragma once` in `print.h`, things go back to normal:

```cpp
#pragma once
void printString(const char* message);

struct CommonMessages {};
```

```bash
End of the file reached during read.
Negative integer detected. Only positive integers permitted.
Floating point number detected. Only integers permitted.
```

As an aside, before `#pragma once` came along, the traditional way to
ensure duplication doesn't occur is with `ifndef ... endif` block. To
illustrate:

```cpp
#ifndef _PRINT_H
#define _PRINT_H
void printString(const char* message);

struct CommonMessages {};
#endif
```

For our purposes, the code above does the same thing as `#pragma once`. It
essentially says that if the symbol `_PRINT_H` is not defined, go ahead and
define. Otherwise, don't define it. This is essentially what `#pragma once`
does. Modern C++ programs use `#pragma once` because it's cleaner and
easier, but there are many C++ programs that continue to use the
traditional method. For most programs, which to use comes down to personal
preference. Most compilers today support `#pragma once`, but there may be
situations where a machine uses a compiler that doesn't support the idiom.
Given how much more widespread `#pragma once` has become, we will use
`#pragma once`.
