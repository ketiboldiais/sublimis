# Variables & Types

In a computer, data is stored inside a memory location. We can think of
computer memory as a large grid of small squares with unique addresses.
These small squares, or cells, are arranged in a logical order. Each cell
can store **1 byte, or 8 bits** of data. A bit is either a 0 or a 1. With 8
bits, we have 256 different combinations (${2^8 = 256.}$) Those
combinations can be used to represent the numbers 0 to 255. In statically
typed languages, we must explicitly state variable's type during
declaration. This tells the compiler what type of data the variable will
store. Given that information, the compiler can determine how much memory
to allocate. To use that data, we must reference that particular location.
In languages like Assembly, this is in fact how we access that data. Now,
these memory locations are fairly cryptic and difficult to read (they're in
hexadecimal). Instead of referencing these memory locations, we can
associate a _name_ to that particular location, and reference that name
instead. This is called a **binding**.

Variables are essentialy "cabinets" where we can place data. Those
cabinets, however, have specific labels called _types_. The data we place
in a cabinet must have a type that matches the label. However, we can
change the contents of the cabinets. More formally, variables are locations
in memory where we can store data. Instead of referring to that location
with its memory address, we give that location a name called an
_identifier_. In source code, the identifier is the name we give a
variable. Identifiers should be descriptive and meaningful, so as to make
later recall easier. Identifiers can only consist of (a) upper-case
alphabets, (b) lower-case alphabets (c) numbers, and (d) underscores.
Additionally, the first character in the identifier must be either an
alphabet or an underscore. Thus, identifiers cannot contain special
characters (`&`, `!`, `#`, `;`, etc.) nor can it contain whitespace.
Upper-case alphabets and lower-case alphabets are distinct. Thus, the
identifier `foo` is different from the identifier `Foo`. A **variable** is
a programming construct that allows us to associate a _value with a name_.
More formally, a variable is a named piece of memory that a programmer uses
to store specific types of data. In other words, it is an abstraction for
the process described previously. Examples of variables in C++:

```cpp
int x; // value is undefined
char grade = 'A';
double pi = 3.14;
```

The value `'A'` and `3.14` are called **literals**. A literal is a value
directly represented inside the program executable (as opposed to a value
that must be accessed through a variable stored somewhere in memory). For
example, the variable `pi` will be stored somewhere in memory. The literal
`3.14`, however, will be directly represented as binary in the executable.
For example, suppose we wrote the following:

A _variable declaration_ is an instruction to the compiler to **reserve**
space in memory for data. Because C++ is a _statically typed_ language,
variable declarations must explicitly include the variable's type. A
_variable initialization_ is an instruction to the compiler to **store**
data in the reserved space.

```cpp
int a = 1
int b = 2
```

When we actually compile the program, the code above looks something like:

| value      | code        |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 001        | a = 1 (int) |
| 002        | b = 2 (int) |
| ${\vdots}$ | ${\vdots}$  |
| 0040       | 1           |
| 0041       | 2           |

The values are called literals because they are _literally_ inside the
source code. They do not need to be represented in memory. Because the
values bound to `a` and `b` are literals, we can use `a` and `b` throughout
our program (this is true because the variables above are presumed to be
declared in the global scope; more on this later).

Note that literals with modifiers, like `long` and `unsigned`, should have
a suffix appended at the end, indicating that the value is a literal:

```cpp
unsigned int ceoBonus {2'000'000u}; // evaluates to 2989 int myOctal {0777u}
unsigned int errorCode = 0xBAD;  // evaluates to 511
float myFloat {1.2f}
```

Notice the use of single quotes as separators. This is particularly helpful
when we have large value literals. Notice also that we can represent hex
numbers in C++.[^hexnote] Hex numbers are also used to indicate colors.
Above, we also see an example of using octal numbers as literals. Notice
that octal numbers are prefaced with a `0`. Because of this use of `0`, be
very careful not to preface `int` values with a `0` if an `int` is
intended.

[^hexnote]:
    Hex numbers are used amusingly (and usefully) in many programs as _hex
    speak._ For example, the hex number `0xBAAAAAAD` is used as an iOS
    exception report (it evaluates to the integer `3131746989`.) Similarly,
    `0xDEADBEEF` is almost ubiquitously used in embedded systems to
    indicate a software crash or a deadlock. These are all examples of
    **magic numbers**; numbers used to indicate a particular value.

In the last line, we see a `float` literal. Notice the suffix `f`. This
suffix must be included if we want to ensure the value is treated as a
`float` literal. If we fail to include the suffix, we risk C++ treating the
value as a `double`.

# Data Types

C++ has three kinds of data types:[^typenote] (1) _primitive types; (2)
derived types_; and (3) _user-defined types_. The primitive types are types
provided by default in C++. They include: `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`,
`boolean`, and `void`. The derived types are types derived from the
primitive data types. They include: `Function`, `Array`, `Pointer`, and
`Reference`. The user-defined types are types defined by the user. They
include: `Structure`, `Union`, `Enum`, `Class`, and `Typedef`.

[^typenote]:
    Mathematically, a data type is really just a _set_. It is the set of
    all the possible values that belong to that type, alongside the
    operations that can be performed on those values.

A variable of type `float`, as well as a variable of type `double`, stores
floating point values (i.e., numbers with a decimal point). `double` is
allocated 8 bytes of memory. Thus, it can store values ranging from
${-2^{63}}$ to ${2^{63} - 1.}$ How precise floating-point value is depends
on how many numbers follow the decimal point. A `float` can store up to 7
digits.

A variable of type `int` takes up 4 bytes of memory. It can store any value
from ${-2^{31}}$ to ${2^{31} - 1.}$ If we store a floating point value
(e.g., ${2.32}$) in an `int` variable, C++ will truncate the value to 2. A
`double` can store up to 15 digits A variable of type `char` stores a
character from the ASCII table. In reality, `char` represents the
character's numeric ASCII value. `char` is allocated 1 byte of memory. It
can store any Unicode value from ${-2^7}$ to ${2^7 - 1.}$

A variable of type `bool` stores one of two values &mdash; `true` or
`false`. A variable of type `bool` is allocated 1 byte of memory. The
`void` data type represents "no value." This is a specific instruction to
the compiler not to allocate any memory.

## Datatype Modifiers

_Data type modifiers_ are special symbols we can prepend to a data type to
modify the data type's instructions. The modifier `long` will instruct the
compiler to allocate 4 more bytes. We can use `long` with `int` and
`double`. The modifier `short` instructs the compiler to only allocate 2
bytes. `short` applies only to `int`. We **cannot** use modifiers with the
`float` type. The `unsigned` modifier allows us to store only positive
values (i.e., values without the signed bit). The `signed` modifier allows
us to store both positive and negative values. `signed` is the default
declaration for `int` and `char`.

## Type Casting

_Type-casting_ is when we instruct the compiler to convert a value of one
type to another. There are two types of type-casting: _implicit casting_
and `explicit casting`. In implicit-casting, the compiler automatically
converts one data type to another. In explicit-casting, we, the
programmers, explicitly instruct the compiler to convert.

The value of `x` above is `undefined`, which is itself a value. It will
display to the console some value, but it could be any value. All of the
types above are **primitive types** in `C++`. There are several others:

| Type               | Size                              | Description             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| char               | ${1}$ byte, ${\geq 8}$ bits       | character               |
| char16_t           | ${\geq 16}$ bits                  |                         |
| char32_t           | ${\geq 32}$ bits                  |                         |
| wchar_t            | largest available character set   |                         |
| short              | ${\geq 16}$ bits                  | signed integer values   |
| short              | ${\geq 16}$ bits                  |                         |
| int                | ${\geq 16}$ bits                  |                         |
| long               | ${\geq 32}$ bits                  |                         |
| long long          | ${\geq 64}$ bits                  |                         |
| unsigned short     | ${\geq 16}$ bits                  | unsigned integer values |
| unsigned           | ${\geq 16}$ bits                  |                         |
| unsigned long      | ${\geq 32}$ bits                  |                         |
| unsigned long long | ${\geq 64}$ bits                  |                         |
| float              | ${\approx}$ ${7}$ decimal places  | non-integer reals       |
| double             | ${\approx}$ ${15}$ decimal places |                         |
| long double        | ${\approx}$ ${19}$ decimal places |                         |
| bool               | usually ${8}$ bits                | true; false             |
| void               | represents "typelessness"         |                         |
| auto               | used to deduce types              |                         |

What data type we use depends on the program we're writing and whether
we're particularly concerned about memory use. If we attempt to assign too
large of a value into a variable type that does not accomodate for that
value's size, we will get an **overflow**.

# Constants

Constants are variables whose bound values are immutable &mdash; the value
cannot be changed. We can initialize constants in C++ as such:

```cpp
const double accelerationGravity { 9.807 }; // meters per second^2
```

A _constant_ is a variable whose constants **cannot** be changed. We can
think of it as a locked cabinet. Because they are locked cabinets,
constants must be initialized and declared at the same time.

The `const` qualifier does not actually apply to the data in memory. In
other words, it's not like the data in memory permanently stays in some
location, never moving, never changing. Instead, the qualifier applies to
the variable name. What this means is, in the variable above,
`accelerationGravity`, we cannot change the value bound to it, `9.807`,
using `accelerationGravity`. This is a crucial distinction to understand,
because there is more than one way to modify a value bound to a variable.
As we will see on the section with pointers, there are situations where we
can accidentally cause a `const` to change.

Question: What if the `const` value depends on the computation of a
non-constant value? Will subsequent changes to the non-constant value cause
changes to the `const` value? Fortunately in C++, no. Once a variable is
initialized as a constant, that value will remain bound to the identifier:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
	int a = 3;
	const int b = 4 + a;
	std::cout << b << std::endl;
	a += 1;
	std::cout << b << std::endl;

	return 0;
}
```

```bash
7
7
```

Constants are what allow us to ensure that a value bound to a particular
identifier is never changed through that identifier. If we, or any part of
our code, attempt to modify that constant through the identifier, we will
get a compiler error.

In general, we should err on the side of using constants. While mutability
is a useful tool, erring on mutability only increases the amount of values
we must keep track of. Some of those values will be things that should
never change, and should not be included in our personal list of tracked
values. Some C++ programmers follow the habit of declaring every variable
as a `const`, then deciding after seeing compiler errors whether to remove
the `const` declaration. This is great habit, as it forces us to more
carefully consider whether we want mutability.

## Constant Expressions

Constant expressions are expressions that are evaluated at compile time
rather than runtime. The default behavior is to perform these computations
at runtime. The problem, however, is that some computations can be
enormous. This means that whenever a user loads an executable (i.e., runs
the program,) the computation may need to be performed again. This
redundancy can amount to large costs in runtime. To declare constant
expressions, we use the `constexpr` keyword:

```cpp
constexpr double pi {3.14};
```

We cannot use non-constant expressions (i.e., **runtime values**) inside
constant expressions (compile-time values). This is because the compiler
cannot perform computations on or with runtime values. Those computations
must be done at runtime.

```cpp
const double e {2.718};
constexpr double myNum { e * 2.2 };  // returns an error
```

The code above returns an error because `e` is a non-constant expression.
To actually perform the computation, `e` must also be a constant
expression:

```cpp
constexpr double e {2.718};
constexpr double myNum { e * 2.2 };  // returns 5.9796
```

Constant expressions are enormously useful in ensuring that we do not waste
valuable runtime. In particular, we almost always want to perform large,
heavy computations at compile time. By doing so, we do not have to waste
valuable runtime performing the large computation. Instead, the computer's
loader will simply retrieve the result from the compiler's computation.

We can think of constant expressions as a cost-shifting mechanism. Rather
than the user paying the price for the large computation, we, as the
programmers, pay the price at computation. Erring on constant expressions,
executables can load much, much faster.[^constnote]

[^constnote]:
    As evidence of how valuable constant expressions are, one of the most
    competitive games in the programming languages market is moving as many
    computations as possible to compile time. With each new standard of C++
    (and other languages like Java), there have been increases in the
    number of movable computations. Given how fast compilers are getting,
    the game is only growing more heated.

Constant expressions are very useful for checks For example, suppose our
program should not proceed any further &mdash; in compilation &mdash;
unless some condition is met. We can do so with `static_assert(${b}$)`,
where ${b}$ is the condition we want met.

```cpp
int main() {
	constexpr int a = 2;
	static_assert(a == 3);
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
main.cpp:5:2: error: static_assert failed due to requirement 'a == 3'
		static_assert(a == 3);
		^             ~~~~~~
1 error generated.
```

Above, our program never actually compiles &mdash; and never gets to
runtime &mdash; because the condition `a == 3` is not met. Separately,
constant expressions are effectively constants, so the expressions cannot
be mutated. `static_assert()` can be a very valuable tool when we are
moving large amounts of computations to compile time, as it reduces the
costs we've shifted to ourselves as programmers.

## The Size Of Operator

The `sizeof()` operator returns the size, in bytes, of a type or variable.
The operator is often used to determine size of arrays, structures, and
objects. We address it here because it is particularly useful for
variables, and will revisit it when we discuss arrays.

`C++` provides several ways to declare and initialize variables:

```cpp
int foo; // declaration; likely contains garbage value
int baz = 17; // assignment initialization
int kwa (43); // constructor initialization; initializes to 43
int xyz {13}; // C++ list initialization; initializes to 13
int bar {}; // initializes to 0

// we can also uses expressions as initializers
int bop {14 + 2}; // initializes to 16
int x {2};
int y {5};
int z {x + y}; // initializes to 7
int g {x + y + i}; // won't compile, i is undeclared
```

Note that if we declare a variable but do not initialize it, that variable
will have some **garbage value** stored, and we have no control over what
that value is. As such, it is crucial that we initialize variables once
declared.

This is a stark contrast to other languages like Java, where there are
default values for uninitialized variables. If you're coming from one of
those languages, beware!

## More on Numeric Types

Numeric types are so important in programming that it's worth exploring
them more deeply. To begin, `C++` has no problem handling positive and
negative numbers:

```cpp
int val1 {1} // a positive integer
int val2 {-1} // a negative integer
```

The code above is a form of syntactic sugar for the following:

```cpp
signed int val1 {1}
signed int val2 {-1}
```

The keyword `signed` is called a **modifier**. A modifier does what it says
&mdash; it modifies what a variable can and cannot do. In this case,
`signed` indicates that the subsequent variable can store positive or
negative numbers. If we want to ensure that a variable can only store
positive numbers, we use the `unsigned` modifier. Whether or not an `int`
is signed or unsigned, the `int` will still occupy 4 bytes in memory.

Signage, however, impacts how many values a given numeric type can
represent. Roughly, where ${n}$ is the number of bits for a type in memory,
unsigned numeric types can represent numbers in the interval ${[0,
2^n-1].}$
Signed integers can store numbers in the interval
${[-2^{n-1},
2^{n-1} - 1].}$ For example, with integers, the `unsigned`
modifier allows us to represent numbers from 0 to about 4.2 billion. With
`signed`, we can represent numbers from about -2.1 billion to 2.1 billion.

There are additional modifiers we can use for numeric types, `short` and
`long`. The `short` and `long` modifiers will modify the number of bytes a
type requires. With `short`, we reduce the range of values we can
represent, but save memory. With `long`, we increase the range of values
can represent, but use up more memory. We can use `short` and `long` with
`signed` and `unsigned` to balance the tradeoffs:

```cpp
// these variables take up 2 bytes
short foo {};
short int bar {};
signed short bang {};
signed short int zing {};
unsigned short int blob {};

// these variables take up 4 bytes
int vroom {};
signed hoho {};
signed int gaga {};
unsigned int didi {};

// these variables take up 4 or 8 bytes
long wawa {};
long int pepe {};
signed long toto {};
signed long int shibi {};
unsigned long int grob {};

// these variables take up 8 bytes
long long jam {};
long long int jip {};
signed long long doop {};
signed long long int coco {};
unsigned long long lulu {};
unsigned long long int momo {};
```

Note that the modifiers `signed`, `unsigned`, `long`, and `short` only work
for **integral types** &mdash; types representing integers. They will not
work for **floating types** &mdash; types representing fractional numbers.

Furthermore, we should be careful when using the `short` and `unsigned`
modifiers with integral types like `short int`. Arithmetic may not work as
expected for an integral type that can take no more than 4 bytes of memory
(e.g., `short int`, which only takes 2 bytes). If the result requires more
than 4 bytes of memory, C++ will return a result in type other than the
operands'. For example, in the case of `short int`, if the result requires
more than 2 bytes of memory, C++ will return a result of type `int`.

## Floats

C++ has three base floating types: `float`, `double`, and `long double`.
The base type `float` takes up 4 bytes of memory, `double` takes up 8
bytes, and `long double` takes up 12 bytes. With floating types, the
primary concern for memory usage is more focused on precision. With 4 bytes
of memory, precision is ensured for up to 7 decimal places (including the
integral part). For `double`, it's 15. With `long double`, it depends on
the compiler implementation; it can range anywhere from 15, 18, to 33. For
the most part, `double` is the recommended type to use, and it suffices for
most programming tasks.

## Scientific Notation

C++ supports scientific notation natively:

```cpp
// x and y are equivalent
double x { 732400023 };
double y { 7.32400023e8 };

// v and w are equivalent
double v { 0.00000000002313 };
double w { 2.313e-11 };
```

## Infinity and NaN

For those familiar with JavaScript, C++ has representations for Infinity
and `NaN`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() { float a { 1.0 }; float b {}; float c { a / b }; // evaluates to Infinity
	float u { 0.0 };
	float v { 0.0 };
	float w { u / v };; // evaluates to NaN

	std::cout << "valueOf c: " << c << std::endl;
	std::cout << "valueOf w: " << w << std::endl;
	return 0;
	}
```

```bash
valueOf c: inf
valueOf w: nan
```

# Division

The arithmetic operations covered are fairly straightforward. Special
attention, however, should be given to division.[^asterisknote]

[^asterisknote]:
    As an aside, the `*` (asterisk) operator's use for multiplication dates
    back to John Backus and his team's development of Fortran. At the time
    (1954), the available character set for computers was limited, and `*`
    was the closest symbol to ${\times.}$

Dividing integers can yield unusual results:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
	int c = 21 / 10; // expected: 2.1
	std::cout << c << std::endl;
}
```

```bash
2
```

Notice that the output is 2. Why is this? What's actually happening is that
C++ is trying to figure out how many times it can fit 10 inside 21. In this
case, 2. This is what happens when we divide an `int` value by a
non-multiple of that value. We won't get back a fractional number. For
that, we need to use float types:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
	double c = 21.0 / 10.0; // expected: 2.1
	std::cout << c << std::endl;
}
```

```bash
2.1
```

## Booleans

Boolean data types represent just two states &mdash; true or false.
Accordingly the data type `bool` in C++ consists of only two values: `true`
and `false`. A Boolean value takes up 8 bits of memory (an entire byte).
This may seem extremely wasteful, particularly from the perspective of
embedded systems, where memory is very scarce. With advances in memory
capacity, however, most programs aren't impacted by the consumption. We
will see in later sections various ways of bundling more data into a byte.

## Characters

In C++, single-character data is represented with `char` type. A `char`
value is represented with single quotes in C++:

```cpp
char foo = 'a';
```

Note that we must use single quotes. Any other symbol will return an error.
The `char` type takes up 1 byte, or 8 bits, of memory. Characters in C++
map to the ASCII table. Thus, each ASCII character has an integer ASCII
encoding.

## The Keyword `auto`

The keyword `auto` is C++'s take on type inference. By appending the
keyword to a variable name, we instruct C++ to infer the bound value's
type. This is particulary useful for when we have particularly long type
names. We can't really appreciate how useful type inference is at the
moment, but we mention it here for completeness.

```cpp
	auto val1 {19}; // type inferred: int
	auto val2 {38.3}; // type inferred: double
	auto val3 {'e'}; // type inferred: char
	auto val4 {2.0f}; // type inferred: float
	auto val5 {290.3l}; // type inferred: long
	auto val6 {923u}; // type inferred: unsigned
	auto val7 {197ul}; // type inferred: unsigned long
	auto val9 {9291ll}; // type inferred: long long
```

## User Input

In the examples above, we used `cout` to output data. `cout` has sibling,
`cin`, which _inputs_ data:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	int userNumber;
	cout << "Pick a number:" << endl;
	cin >> userNumber;
	cout << "You picked: " << userNumber << endl;

	return 0;
}
```

```bash
Pick a number:
27
You picked: 27
```

## Global v. Local

Variables declared inside the `main()` function are said to be **local
variables**:

```cpp
int zob {1};

int main() {
	int fen {25};
	int jib {12};
}
```

In the code above, `fen` and `jib` are local variables. We say they are
local variables because their scope (visibility) is within the `main()`
function. Put differently, the variables `fen` and `gib` only exist inside
the `main()` function. Outside of the `main()` function, they effectively
do not exist.

In contrast, the variable `zob` is a **global variable**. This means they
are visible to everything in the program. Which in turn means they can be
changed from anywhere and by anything in the program.

## Naming

`C++` has a few naming rules we must follow: (1) Variables can contain
letters, numbers, and underscores; (2) Variables must begin with a letter
or underscore; (3) Cannot use reserved symbols; and (4) cannot _redeclare_
a name in the same scope.
