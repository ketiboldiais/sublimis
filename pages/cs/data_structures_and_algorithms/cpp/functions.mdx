In the simplest terms, a function is a piece of code that performs a
specific task. It takes inputs, called **arguments**, and returns an
output, called a **return value**. There are many ways to think about
functions. For now, we can think of functions as ways to _modularize_ our
code. If we have a particular computation that must be performed over and
over again, that computation would be best capsulated as a function. For
example, consider this code that prints out an array:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() { int arr[]{1, 2, 3, 4}; int sizeOfArr = sizeof(arr) /
sizeof(int); for (int i = 0; i < sizeOfArr; i++) { cout << arr[i] << " "; }
cout << endl; return 0; }

```

If we had multiple arrays, we would have to write that `for` loop multiple
times.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int arr1[]{1, 2, 3, 4};
	int arr2[]{5, 6, 7, 8};
	int sizeOfArr1 = sizeof(arr1) / sizeof(int);
	int sizeOfArr2 = sizeof(arr2) / sizeof(int);
	for (int i = 0; i < sizeOfArr1; i++) {
		cout << arr1[i] << " ";
	}
	cout << endl;
	for (int i = 0; i < sizeOfArr2; i++) {
		cout << arr2[i] << " ";
	}
	cout << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

It would be much cleaner if we just wrote a function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void printIntArr(int arr[], int length);

int main() { int arr1[]{1, 2, 3, 4}; int arr2[]{5, 6, 7, 8}; int
sizeOf_arr1 = sizeof(arr1) / sizeof(int); int sizeOf_arr2 = sizeof(arr2) /
sizeof(int); printIntArr(arr1, sizeOf_arr1); printIntArr(arr2,
sizeOf_arr2); return 0; }

void printIntArr(int arr[], int length) { for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
{ cout << arr[i] << " "; } cout << endl; }

```

It may look like there's not much of a difference, but we have effectively
modularized our code, allowing us to call it whenever we'd like, for
however many arrays we want, without having to write `for` loops over and
over. To clean the code up a bit more, we can use a macro (don't worry
about this for now, we will expore macros in later sections):

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#define SIZEOF(a) sizeof(a)/sizeof(*a)

void printIntArr(int arr[], int length);

int main() { int arr1[]{1, 2, 3, 4}; int arr2[]{5, 6, 7, 8};
printIntArr(arr1, SIZEOF(arr1)); printIntArr(arr2, SIZEOF(arr2)); return 0;
}

void printIntArr(int arr[], int length) { for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
{ cout << arr[i] << " "; } cout << endl; }

```

Erring on the side of functions when writing code is a hallmark of the
programming paradigm **functional programming**. The benefits of functional
programming is modularized code, and it is the exact opposite of
**monolithic programming** &mdash; writing all of our code in a single
area, such as `main()`. If we wrote all of our code in `main()`, then we
take on several risks. First, suppose our program spanned several thousand
lies (not at all unusual). If we so happen to encounter a bug, we would
have to weave through several thousand lines trying to pinpoint the
problem. With modularized code, we can more quickly find the source by
examining each module separately. Moreover, modularized code avoids
cross-contamination by isolating pieces of code.

Second, our program required performing a computation in a for loop, or a
computation in a function, or a computation in a function in a function
(again, not at all unusual). Without using functions, we would have to copy
and paste the computation's code everywhere it's needed. This is (1) not
productive and (2) almost assuredly will cause bugs (think about how many
times you've copied and pasted and missed a character; one character is all
it takes in programming).

In `C++`, the order in which we write functions matters. Any call to a
function must be made after the function is implemented. For example, the
following will not work:

```cpp
int main() {
	double a = circleArea(2.0);
	return 0;
}
double circleArea(double r) {
	double pi = 3.14;
	double area = 2 * pi * r;
	return area;
}
```

```bash
error: ‘circleArea’ was not declared in this scope
```

The correct syntax:

```cpp
double circleArea(double r) {
	double pi = 3.14;
	double area = 2 * pi * r;
	return area;
}
int main() {
	double a = circleArea(2.0);
	return 0;
}
```

Most programmers, however, do not like having these implementations before
the `main()` function. The `main()` function is where all of the primary
source code lies, so we usually want to see that as soon as possible. To do
so, we include **function prototypes** before `main()`. This prototype
serves as sort of a "heads up" to the compiler about an upcoming function.
It takes the form:

`${t_r}$ ${f}$(${t_0 \space p_0, \ldots, t_n \space p_n}$)`

${t_r}$ represents the function's _return type_ (the type of the function's
output). ${f}$ is the function's _name_. ${t_0, \ldots, t_n}$ are the types
of the function's parameters. ${p_0,
\ldots, p_n}$ are the parameter. Notice
that just like variables, the parameters in a `C++` function must have
explicitly declared types.

Thus, we can rewrite the erroneous example above as:

```cpp
double circleArea(double r);

int main() {
	double a = circleArea(2.0);
	return 0;
}
double circleArea(double r) {
	double pi = 3.14;
	double area = 2 * pi * r;
	return area;
}
```

Obviously, a program can have numerous functions, in which case we might
have hundreds, if not thousands, of function protoypes. This is when we
start writing functions in separate files, and `include` them in our
primary source code file. These files are called **header files**, and we
discuss them in more detail in a later section.

Some functions do not explicitly return a value. What is the return type
for these functions? It is `void`:

`void `${f}$(${t_0 \space p_0, \ldots, t_n \space p_n}$`)`

The keyword `void` only applies to return types. We cannot have a `void`
parameter, and we cannot have `void` variables.

The above syntax is for function protoypes. When we actually implement the
function, we use the following syntax:

```
rt f(p0, p0, ..., tn pn) {
	tv v;
	statements;
	return v;
}
```

In the syntax above, ${r_t}$ is the return type of the function, ${f}$ is
the name of the function, ${t_n}$ are the types for the parameters, ${p_n}$
are the parameters, ${t_v}$ is the return type for the variable that will
store the return, and ${v}$ is the variable that will store the return. For
example:

```cpp
double Average(double a, double b) {
	double sum = a + b;
	return sum / 2;
}

int main() { double mid = average(10.2, 11.8); cout << mid << endl; return
0; }

```

One quirk of `C++` is that order absolutely matters. All of our actual
source code is located in the `main` function, so any function that is
called inside `main` must be defined before `main`. More generally, a
function must always be defined before it is called.

In the code above, the `average()` function is called the **callee
function** &mdash; it is the function that is called. The `main()` function
is called the **caller function** &mdash; the function that calls.

In the function `average()`, we have `double a` and `double b`. These are
the _parameters_ of `average()`. The variables `a` and `b` exist only
inside the function `average()`. They exist nowhere else but the
`average()` function. Likewise, the variable `mid` exists only inside the
`main()` function. This means that `average()` has no access to `mid`, and
`main()` has no access to `a` and `b`.

Default Values. In `C++`, we can set default values for function
parameters. For example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int increment(int a, int b=1) {
	int result = a + b;
	return result;
}

int main() {
	int a = increment(1);
	int b = increment(1, 2);
	cout&lt;&lt;a&lt;&lt;endl;
	cout&lt;&lt;b;

	return 0;
}
```

```bash
2
3
```

## Why use functions?

Functions are more than just a way of reusing code. They are the building
blocks for _procedural decomposition_ &mdash; breaking down a program into
smaller and smaller pieces. In a good `C++` program, the `main()` function
is the overarching function that calls _helper functions_. We should think
of `main()` as a function akin to the conductor of a gargantuan orchestra;
it simply drives, or directs, the order in which the helper functions are
called.

The helper functions should meet several criteria: (1) The helper function
performs one, and only one, coherent task. (2) The function does not do too
large a share of the work. (3) The function is not overly reliant on other
functions. And (4) the function stores data in the narrowest scope
possible.
