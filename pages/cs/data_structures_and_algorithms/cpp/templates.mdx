# Templates in C++

Templates are one of the most powerful features of C++. They're similar to
generics in Java, but they are much, much more powerful. Understanding
templates is critical to learning C++. They are used throughout the
standard library, and they make numerous tasks previously tedious in C++
much easier. To begin, let's consider the `swap()` function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
void swap(int &var1, int &var2) {
	int temp = var1;
	var1 = var2;
	var2 = temp;
}
int main() {
	int a = 0;
	int b = 1;
	std::cout << "a = " << a << std::endl;
	std::cout << "b = " << b << std::endl;
	swap(a, b);
	std::cout << "a = " << a << std::endl;
	std::cout << "b = " << b << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
a = 0
b = 1
a = 1
b = 0
```

If we wanted to swap `double` type values, we'd have to write a separate
function for that, since our `swap()` function takes `int` type arguments.
More generally, we'd have to write separate swapping functions for swapping
values not of type `int`. We can give the functions the same name
`print()`—overloading—to avoid having to remember different function names.
The problem, however, is that this is pretty repetitive. We're copying and
pasting code, and changing just a few things. As we know, we generally
despise repetitive tasks in programming.

This repetition is precisely what templates are intended to remedy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template<typename T>
void swap(T &var1, T &var2) {
	T temp = var1;
	var1 = var2;
	var2 = temp;
}

int main() {
	int a = 0;
	int b = 1;
	std::cout << "a = " << a << std::endl;
	std::cout << "b = " << b << std::endl;
	swap(a, b);
	std::cout << "a = " << a << std::endl;
	std::cout << "b = " << b << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
a = 0
b = 1
a = 1
b = 0
```

The new piece of syntax is the `template<typename T>`. This is called a
**template**. The general syntax for the template:

```cpp
template <typename t_0 ... typename t_n>
```

Note that `typename` can be replaced with `class`. We use `typename` for
clarity. When we use a template with a function, as is the case with
`swap()`, the resulting function is called a **template function**.

When we write a template function and call that function, we are
effectively telling the compiler to write the function for us, then execute
the function. For example, let's say we wrote:

```cpp
template<typename T1, typename T2>
void foo(T1 a, T2 b) {
	...
};

int n = 1;
double m = 2;
foo(n, m);
```

When the compiler reaches `foo(n, m)`, it replaces `T1` with `int`, the
type for `n`, and it replaces `T2` with `double`, the type for `m`. This
results in the function:

```cpp
void foo(int a, double b) { ... };
```

The compiler effectively wrote the function for us, then executed it. We
can think of the template function as a blueprint for the function we want.
For example, returning to our swapping example, we have several lines for
printing out the results of the swap. We can write a template function,
`print()`, for that task:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

template<typename T>
void swap(T &var1, T &var2) {
	T temp = var1;
	var1 = var2;
	var2 = temp;
}

template<typename T0, typename T1>
void print(T0 message, T1 x) {
	std::cout << message << x << std::endl;
}

int main() {
	int a = 0;
	int b = 1;
	print("a = ", a);
	print("b = ", b);
	swap(a, b);
	print("a = ", a);
	print("b = ", b);
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
a = 0
b = 1
a = 1
b = 0
```

Here, we see two template parameters, `T0` and `T1`. When the compiler gets
to `print()`, it replaces `T0` with whatever type is passed, in this case
`string`, and it replaces `T1` with whatever type is passed. In this case,
`int`.

Examining this process, we can see that template functions work only if C++
knows the function arguments' types. We can ensure this condition is met by
explicitly stating the type, or by relying on type inference. Of the two
options, templates are almost always used in reliance of type inference.

Importantly, template functions do not exist unless we call them. For
example, consider the following template function that outputs to the
console the elements of an array:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template<typename T>
void print(T &arr) {
	int arraySize = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
	std::cout << "[ ";
	for (int i = 0; i < arraySize; i++) {
		if (i > 0) {std::cout << ", ";}
		std::cout << arr[i];
	}
	std::cout << " ]" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
	int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
	print(arr);
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
```

Let's deliberately place a bug in the template function by removing the
index's type `int` from the for-loop, and remove the call `print()` in
`main()`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template<typename T>
void print(T &arr) {
	int arraySize = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
	std::cout << "[ ";
	for (i = 0; i < arraySize; i++) {
		if (i > 0) {std::cout << ", ";}
		std::cout << arr[i];
	}
	std::cout << " ]" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
	int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
	return 0;
}
```

For some compilers, the code above will compile just fine. Why? Because
there was no call `print()`, so the compiler didn't have construct and
execute it.[^compilernote] This evidences a crucial point about template
functions: They do not exist unless we call them. They're just blueprints.
On the other hand, whenever we call a template function, the compiler will
write a function based on the facts we provide. This in turn means that if
we provide different facts, the compiler will create different functions.
For example, if we used our `print()` function for different arrays of
different types:

[^compilernote]:
    This phenomenon is entirely compiler dependent. Compilers like clang
    will compile the template function, even if we do not call the
    function.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template<typename T> void print(T &arr) { int arraySize = sizeof(arr) /
sizeof(arr[0]); std::cout << "[ "; for (int i = 0; i < arraySize; i++) { if
(i > 0) {std::cout << ", ";} std::cout << arr[i]; } std::cout << " ]" <<
std::endl; }

int main() { int arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}; double arr2[] = {1.1, 1.2, 1.3,
1.4}; print(arr1); print(arr2); return 0; }

```

```bash
[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
[ 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 ]
```

the actual code would look like:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void print(int &arr) {
	int arraySize = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
	std::cout << "[ ";
	for (int i = 0; i < arraySize; i++) {
		if (i > 0) {std::cout << ", ";}
		std::cout << arr[i];
	}
	std::cout << " ]" << std::endl;
}

void print(double &arr) {
	int arraySize = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
	std::cout << "[ ";
	for (int i = 0; i < arraySize; i++) {
		if (i > 0) {std::cout << ", ";}
		std::cout << arr[i];
	}
	std::cout << " ]" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
	int arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
	double arr2[] = {1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4};
	print(arr1);
	print(arr2);
	return 0;
}
```

## Class Templates

The real power behind templates is when they're used with classes. Much of
the standard library's classes, like `vector`, are implemented with
templates. To see this in action, let's create a simple class called
`List`.

For `List` class, we want to create a C-style array in the stack. As we
know, to create these arrays, we have to indicate their size. Using a
template:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template<int N>
class List {
	private:
		int m_list[N];
	public:
		int GetSize() const { return N; }
};

int main() {
	List<8> arr;
	std::cout << arr.GetSize() << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
8
```

Here, we have a slight variance from the syntax we used with functions.
Instead of writing `typename`, we instead passed an explicit type, `int`,
followed by an identifier `N`. When we write `List<8>` in `main()`, we
create an instance of `List`: an array of size `N == 8`.

As evidence of the standard library's extensive use of templates, notice
that `List<8>` looks the same as the syntax `vector<int>`. This is no
coincidence; vectors are implemented via templates.

Returning to our example, we can go a step further and make our `List`
type's array be of any type. Let's also add a function for inserting and
retrieving a value at a given index:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template<typename T, int N>
class List {
	private:
		T m_list[N];
	public:
		int GetSize() const { return N; }
		int ValueAt(int i) {
			return m_list[i];
		}
		void Insert(int i, T val) {
			m_list[i] = val;
		}
};

int main() {
	List<int, 8> arr;
	arr.Insert(0, 22);
	std::cout << arr.ValueAt(0) << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
22
```

Think carefully about what we're doing here. We're essentially writing code
instructing the compiler to write code. This is a form of
**metaprogramming**—the programming technique of writing programs that take
other programs as their data.

As we can probably tell, the idea of writing programs that output programs
can get very, very crazy. In fact, it's so easy to go overboard with
metaprogramming that some software companies outright prohibit their
employees from using the technique. This is not because metaprogramming is
some "dark art." It's more so because metaprograms can be enormously
difficult to prove. Reasoning through a metaprogram is essentially
reasoning through two different systems and their interactions: (1) the
program the human writes, and (2) the program the compiler writes.
Human-written programs can be difficult as it is; bad or non-existent
comments, poor naming, unhygienic practices, among other sins. With
metaprogramming, we're adding another layer of difficulty: the
compiler-written program. With a large enough program, we need a strong
understanding of the type-inference system to reason through the
code—something even the most accomplished programmers may not have.
