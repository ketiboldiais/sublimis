# Value v. Reference Semantics

In languages like `C++` and Java, when variables are passed as parameters,
the values bound to those values are copied. For example:

```cpp
	void swap(int a, int b) {
		int temp = a;
		a = b;
		b = temp;
	}
	int main() {
		int x = 17;
		int y = 35;
		cout << "x = " << x << ", y = " << y << endl;
		swap(x, y);
		cout << "x = " << x << ", y = " << y << endl;
		return 0;
	}
```

```bash
	x = 17, y = 35
	x = 17, y = 35
```

No swap occurs because we are passing _copies_ of values into the
variables. In other words, `x` and `y` always remain `17` and `35`
respectively because only copies of those values were passed into the
function. Any computation done in `swap()` was done on copies of those
values, so there no effect on `x` and `y`, the originals.

This phenomenon, called _pass-by-value_, is not the only behavior in `C++`.
There is also _pass-by-reference_, which relies on _reference semantics_.
Here is an example using reference semantics:

```cpp
	void swap(int& a, int& b) {
		int temp = a;
		a = b;
		b = temp;
	}
	int main() {
		int x = 17;
		int y = 35
		cout << "x = " << x << ", y = " << y << endl;
		swap(x, y);
		cout << "x = " << x << ", y = " << y << endl;
	}
```

```bash
	x = 17, y = 35
	x = 35, y = 17
```

Notice the use of the ampersand, `&`. This tells `C++` that we want a
_reference_ to the value. Because we are using a reference rather than a
copy, changes to the parameter will affect the variable passed
in.[^referencenote] <sup></sup>

[^referencenote]:
    Passing by reference is usually best to avoid. With more reference
    values, it becomes more difficult to reason about code, and when that
    difficulty increases, the more difficult it is to debug. In some
    languages like Ruby, there are naming conventions in place to ensure
    reference or mutable values are physically visible. Although `C++` has
    no such conventions, it is recommended to follow some sort of
    convention denoting which variables employ reference semantics. Or
    better yet, avoid using reference semantics as much as possible. There
    are situations of course where referance semantics are necessary. I.e.,
    very large objects (e.g., massive data structures), should likely be
    passed as references. There is a balance, but for run-of-the-mill code,
    we generally want to avoid passing by reference.

Another point for concern with reference values is when we use reference
variables as parameters to functions. In `C++`, reference parameters can
only take variables as arguments. In other words, we can never pass a
literal to a reference parameter (after all, the whole point of reference
semantics is to _refer_ to something). Having said all these negatives, we
should acknowledge the benefits of reference parameters: (1) We have a way
of &#8220;returning&#8221; more than one value with functions, and (2) we
have a way of avoiding making bulky copies of large objects when passing
them as arguments.
