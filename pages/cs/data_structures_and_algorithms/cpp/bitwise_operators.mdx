# Bitwise Operators

The bitwise operators are interesting, but not often used operators in C++.
They are operators that allow us to manipulate data at the bit-level,
rather than one the entire value. The operators are the following:

## Bitwise `&`

Given bit1 and bit2, bit1 & bit2 are 1 if, and only if, both bits are 1.
Otherwise, bit1 & bit2 are 0. For example, using the bitwise operator `&`:

```cpp
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int x = 1;
	int y = 2;
	int z = x & y;
	cout << z << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
0
```

Why is it 0? Because of the following:

$$
	0 1 \\
	1 0
$$

The `&` operator will pair each bit in `x` with each bit in `y`. In this
case, `1 & 0` and `0 & 1`. Now, recall the rule: `bit1 & bit2` are 1 if,
and only if, both values are 1. Otherwise, `bit1 & bit2` are 0. Thus,
`x & y` evaluates to `00`, the integer 0 in the decimal system.

## Bitwise `|`

Bitwise OR; if either bit1 or bit2 is 1, then bit1 | bit2 is 1.

## Bitwise `^`

Bitwise XOR; if bit1 or bit2 is 1, but not both bit1 and bit2 are 1, then
bit1 ^ bit2 is 1. If both bit1 and bit2 is 0, then bit1 | bit2 is 1. If
both bit1 and bit2 is 1, then bit1 | bit2 is 0.

## Bitwise `~`
Bitwise NOT; if bit1 is 1, then ~bit1 is 0, and vice versa.

## Bitwise `<<`
Bitwise left shift.

## Bitwise `>>`
Bitwise right shift.
