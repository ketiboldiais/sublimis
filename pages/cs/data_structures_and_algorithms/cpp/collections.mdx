# Collections

Below, we investigate the basic constructs provided by C++ for user-defined
data types: enums, classes, structs, and many others. Understanding these
constructs is critical, as they are the basic building blocks of
object-oriented programming.

## Arrays

Arrays are the simplest data structure. Physically, arrays occupy a
contiguous region of memory in the computer. We can initialize an array in
C++ with the following:

```cpp
int main() {
	int x[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
	cout << x << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
0x7ffeeb1462d0
```

The line above declares a variable `arr`, which will store an `int` array
of size 10. In other words, an array that can _only_ take 10 values of type
`int`.

The output we see above is a _memory address_. Specifically, it's the
memory address for where the array begins. This evidences the fact that an
array, physically, is a contiguous region in memory.

We can access individual elements in the array with square-bracket syntax:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


int main() {
	int x[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
	cout << x[0] << endl;
	cout << x[1] << endl;
	cout << x[2] << endl;
	cout << x[3] << endl;
	cout << x[4] << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
1
2
3
4
5
```

Notice that like most other languages, C++ indexes its arrays starting
from 0. This means that if we start a loop at 0 and use ${i}$ as a counter,
then the last element in the array is ${n-1,}$ where ${n}$ is the size of
the array. E.g., the size of the array above is 5, but the last element's
index is 4. This is point where many beginning programmers make mistakes,
most commonly seen in a _fence post problem_ &mdash; going one unit beyond
the limit. This can lead to frustrating bugs like an out-of-bounds error:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


int main() {
	int x[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
	cout << x[5] << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
main.cpp:7:10: warning: array index 5 is past the end of the array (which contains 5 elements) [-Warray-bounds]
		cout << x[5] << endl;
						^ ~
main.cpp:6:2: note: array 'x' declared here
				int x[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
				^
1 warning generated.
```

Let's print out all the elements in the array:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


int main() {
	int x[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
	size_t LengthOfx = sizeof x / sizeof x[0];
	for (int i = 0; i < LengthOfx; i++) {
		cout << x[i] << endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
1
2
3
4
5
```

Above, we used the `sizeof` operator to obtain the array's length. The
`sizeof` operator is a built-in operator that returns the number of bytes
allocated to a particular variable. Thus, when we call `sizeof x`, we are
asking for the number of bytes for the _entire_ array. To obtain the actual
length of the array, we need to divide that number by the number of bytes
for each element in the array.

Alternatively, starting with C++11, we can use a **range-based
loop**:[^loopnote]

[^loopnote]: The range-based loop is also called a **for-each loop**.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() { int x[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; cout << "[ "; for (auto i : x)
cout << i << ", "; cout << "]" << endl; return 0; }

```

```bash
[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ]
```

Note that the code above was compiled with the following `make` file:

```bash
CXX=g++
CXXFLAGS=-g -Wall -MMD -std=c++20
clean:
	$(RM) *.o *.d output
```

The `auto` keyword is used to infer the type of an array. We could've used
`int` just as well.

## Grids; Matrices

A **grid**, or **matrix**, is an abstraction of a **multidimensional
array**. A multidimensional array is simply an array whose elements are
themselves arrays. For example, a 2-dimensional array is an array whose
elements arrays. A 3-dimensional array is an array whose elements are
2-dimensional arrays. And a 4-dimensional array is an array whose elements
are 3-dimensional array arrays. We can visualize these multi-dimensional
arrays as such:

![A multidimensional array, visualized as a cube.](https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1652735103/cs/multi_dimensional_array_y67oib.svg)

For example, here is a 2-dimensional array:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char \*argv[]) {
	int a[3][3] = &lcub;{0, 1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}, {6, 7, 8}&rcub;;

	cout << "i a[i][j]" << endl;
	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
			cout << i << " " << a[i][j] << endl;
		}
	}

	return 0;
}

```

```bash
i a[i][j]
0 0
0 1
0 2
1 3
1 4
1 5
2 6
2 7
2 8
```

Notice how we must use a nested for loop to target each element in the
nested array.

## Pointers & Grids.

### Exercises

Because of how important arrays are in computer science, it's critical that
we are comfortable with using them. Below are some exercises.

Given the array: `[3, 9, 11, 23, 14, 10, 34, 18, 27]`, compute the sum of
all the elements.

**Solution** Here is one possible solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


int main() {
	int arr[] = { 3, 9, 11, 23, 14, 10, 34, 18, 27 };
	int sum = 0;
	for(int i:arr)
		sum += i;
	cout << (int)sum << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
149
```

-Given the same array above, return the maximum.

**Solution**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


int main() {
	int arr[] = { 3, 9, 11, 23, 14, 10, 34, 18, 27 };
	size_t LengthOfArr = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
	int max = arr[0];
	for (int i = 0; i < LengthOfArr; i++) {
		if (arr[i] > max) {
			max = arr[i];
		}
	}
	cout << (int)max << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
34
```

-Given the same array, return the minimum.

**Solution**

```cpp
	#include <iostream>
	using namespace std;


	int main() {
		int arr[] = { 3, 9, 11, 23, 14, 10, 34, 18, 27 };
		size_t LengthOfArr = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
		int max = arr[0];
		for (int i = 0; i < LengthOfArr; i++) {
			if (arr[i] < max) {
				max = arr[i];
			}
		}
		cout << (int)max << endl;
		return 0;
	}
```

```bash
	3
```

Given the array above, determine (i.e., return true, or 1) if the element
67 is in the array; otherwise false (0).

**Solution**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


int main() {
	int arr[] = { 3, 9, 11, 23, 14, 10, 34, 18, 27 };
	size_t LengthOfArr = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
	int queryElement = 67;
	bool result = false;
	for (int i = 0; i < LengthOfArr; i++)
	{
		if (arr[i] == queryElement) {
			result = true;
		}
	}
	cout << result << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
0
```

The last exercise above is an example of a **linear search** algorithm. We
are searching for a particular element. Given very large arrays, we can
suspect that this is a grossly inefficient algorithm. Why? Because the
computer must check, one by one, whether the value exists. In this case,
the number 67 doesn't exist in the array. The computer had to go through
all of the elements to make that determination!

## Vectors

As we can likely tell, arrays in C++ are restrictive and somewhat
dangerous. They are examples of _static lists_ &mdash; an indexed list of
elements with a _fixed_ size. We cannot delete elements, nor can we insert
elements (at least not without the use of pointers). We can resize them,
but it's a long and unwieldy process. Perhaps worst of all, C++ allows us
to index out of the array's bounds. Contrast this with a language like
Python, which provides _dynamic lists_ &mdash; lists that can grow and
shrink as needed. For most tasks involving an array-based data structure,
that's what we want &mdash; a dynamic list.

Through the standard library, C++ provides dynamic lists. Where Python
simply calls them a list, C++ opts for **vectors**. To use vectors in our
program, we will have to use a preprocessor: `#include <vector>. Example:`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	vector<int> arrNums {22, 48, 92, 44};
	cout << arrNums[1] << endl;
	arrNums[1] = 14;
	cout << arrNums[1] << endl;
}
```

```bash
48
14
```

Notice that we can using the usual indexing methods. More importantly, we
can mutate the array. Vectors in C++ also come with a variety of member
functions. Some of the most common ones:

| Member Function    | Description                                                 | Comment                                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `v.push_back(val)` | Appends the value ${val}$ to the end of the vector ${v.}$   |
| `v.clear()`        | Removes all elements in the vector ${v.}$                   |
| `v[i]`             | Returns the value at index ${i}$                            | Alternative syntax: `v.get(i)`                         |
| `v.insert(i, val)` | Inserts the element ${val}$ just before index ${i}$         | Operation shifts the subsequent elements to the right. |
| `v.empty()`        | Returns true if ${v}$ contains no elements; else false.     |
| `v.erase(i)`       | Removes _and_ returns the value at index ${i.}$             | Operation shifts subsequent elements to the left.      |
| `v[i] = val`       | Replaces the element at index ${i}$ with the value ${val.}$ | Alternative syntax: `v.assign(i, val)`                 |
| `v.size()`         | Returns the number of elements in the vector.               |                                                        |

Vectors in C++ are implemented via templates.[^templatenote] Accordingly,
we can create vectors with elements of any established type, so long as we
specify it in the angle brackets. E.g., `vector<double>`, or
`vector<std::string>`.

[^templatenote]:
    For more information on templates,
    [_See_ Function Templates](cpp_function_templates).

## When should we use a vector?

The vector type represents an indexed, linear, and homogenous collection.
Accordingly, we want to use a vector whenever we're dealing with a
homogenous list. For example, a list of prices, names, an order of true or
false values, or even an ordered list of ordered lists (although, we'll see
that we might want to use a better data structure for lists of the lists,
the _grid_).

Vectors are useful because they provide several features: (1) We can obtain
the list's size; (2) we can safely access the list (i.e., if we go out of
bounds, we'll get an error); (3) storage is automatically handled (i.e., it
grows and shrinks without us having to do anything); (4) we can insert and
remove; and (5) we can produce deep-copies on assignment, as well as pass-
and return-by-value.

## Enumerations

Enumerations are what we use to represent a range of _discrete_ values. An
example most commonly cited is the range of months in a year: January,
February, March, April, May, etc. are all discrete months. There are,
however, numerous other examples of enumerations: letter grades, traffic
lights, the planets, zodiac signs, days of the week, and many more.

Here's an example of an enumeration (an enum) in C++:

```cpp
enum class LetterGrade {
	A,
	B,
	C,
	D,
	F
}
```

Writing the above, we've created a new data type called `LetterGrade`. This
means we can use it as we would base types:

```cpp
enum class LetterGrade {
	A,
	B,
	C,
	D,
	F
}
LetterGrade johnsGrade = {LetterGrade::A}
```

Notice the syntax for initialization. We explicitly state the type, as we
would any other variable. But in initializing the value, we again state the
type alongside double colons `::`. Each of `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and `F` are
called **enumerators**.

Notice what happens when we cast a `LetterGrade` value into an `int`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

enum class LetterGrade {
	A,
	B,
	C,
	D,
	F
};

int main() {
	LetterGrade johnsGrade{LetterGrade::A};
	std::cout << "John's grade: " << static_cast<int>(johnsGrade) << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
John's grade: 0
```

In C++, enums are actually a range of integers under the hood. By default,
the enumerators start at 0 and increment by 1, all the way up to however
many enumerators we've specified. These integers are called **raw values**.
We can change the default behavior by setting an initial raw value:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

enum class LetterGrade {
	A = 1,
	B,
	C,
	D,
	F
};

int main() {
	LetterGrade johnsGrade{LetterGrade::A};
	std::cout << "John's grade: " << static_cast<int>(johnsGrade) << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```

With this modification, we see the following:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

enum class LetterGrade {
	A = 1,
	B,
	C,
	D,
	F
};

int main() {
	LetterGrade johnsGrade{LetterGrade::A};
	std::cout << "John's grade: " << static_cast<int>(johnsGrade) << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
John's grade: 1
```

We aren't limited to just positive integers. We can change them to
negatives as well:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

enum class LetterGrade {
	A = -1,
	B,
	C,
	D,
	F
};

int main() {
	LetterGrade johnsGrade{LetterGrade::A};
	LetterGrade bobsGrade{LetterGrade::B};
	LetterGrade iansGrade{LetterGrade::C};
	LetterGrade zanesGrade{LetterGrade::D};
	LetterGrade heathersGrade{LetterGrade::F};
	std::cout << "John's grade: " << static_cast<int>(johnsGrade) << std::endl;
	std::cout << "Bob's grade: " << static_cast<int>(bobsGrade) << std::endl;
	std::cout << "Ian's grade: " << static_cast<int>(iansGrade) << std::endl;
	std::cout << "Zane's grade: " << static_cast<int>(zanesGrade) << std::endl;
	std::cout << "Heather's grade: " << static_cast<int>(heathersGrade) << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
John's grade: -1
Bob's grade: 0
Ian's grade: 1
Zane's grade: 2
Heather's grade: 3
```

## Size of an Enum.

Because enumerators are inherently `int`s, the size of an enumerator will
be the size of an `int`, as determined by the compiler. Thus, if the
compiler employs a size of 4 bytes for `int`, then each enumerator has a
size of 4 bytes.

We can, however, change an enumerator's internal representation. In other
words, we aren't limited to `int`:

```cpp
enum class ErrorMessages: unsigned char {
	0,
	1,
	2,
	3
};
```

Above, we tell `C++` that each of the values above are represented as
`unsigned char`. This means that we are limited to a numeric range of 0
to 255.

### Use Cases

Enums are useful for when we have a discrete set of categories for values.
One use case we see in the real world is an application's set of possible
options. For example:

```cpp
enum class UserOptions {
	New,
	Open,
	Save,
	SaveAs,
	Close,
	Export
};
```

## Structs

C++ also supports **record types**, which we can define with the keyword
`struct`. For example:

```cpp
struct Coordinate_2D {
	double x;
	double y;
};
```

defines a new record type called `Coordinate_2D`. Having defined the record
type, we can then use it in our source code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Coordinate_2D {
	double x;
	double y;
};

int main() {
	Coordinate_2D point1;
	point1.x = 1.1;
	point1.y = 2.7;
	cout << point1.x << endl;
	cout << point1.y << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
1.1
2.7
```

## Type Synonyms

Like many other languages, C++ provides the ability to implement _type
synonyms_ (other languages might call these _type aliases_). For those
unfamiliar, a type synonym is simply another name for an existing type.
Type synonyms are particularly useful for readability:

```cpp
typedef int wholeNumber
```

The type definition above creates another name for `int`, called
`wholeNumber`. Every line of code thereafter, we can use `wholeNumber` just
as we would `int`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

typedef unsigned int naturalNumber;

int main() {
	naturalNumber x = 7;
	naturalNumber y = 2;
	naturalNumber z = x + y;
	cout << z << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
9
```
