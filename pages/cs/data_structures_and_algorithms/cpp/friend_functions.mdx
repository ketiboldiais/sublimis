# Friend Functions

In mathematics, we often have symbols that can apply to different values.
For example, ${1 + 2}$ and ${1.4 + 4.2}$ both mean addition, regardless of
the fact that ${1,2 \in \Z^{+}}$ and ${1.4 + 4.2 \in \mathbb{Q}.}$ The
values belong to different sets, but the ${+}$ works nevertheless.
Mathematics could have gone a different route, using different symbols for
addition, depending on which set the terms belonged to.

Other symbols, however, can have different meanings depending on the terms
used. For example, most people would recognize the ${\times}$ symbol in
${A \times B}$ as indicating multiplication. However, if ${A}$ and ${B}$
were vectors—an object with magnitude and direction—then the ${A \times B}$
is a cross product. This yields two very different computations:
${A \times B = AB,}$ and ${A \times B = ||A|| \space ||B|| \sin \theta n.}$

The same phenomon occurs in programming. The operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and
`/` perform on both `int` and `double`.

C++ allows us to extend this overloading by permitting us to define what a
symbol like `+` does in a given set of conditions. Maybe we want
`"tiger" + "lion"` to evaluate to `"liger"`. This would be an example of
we, the programmers, overloading an operator in C++. Let's consider an
example.

In mathematics, ${\sqrt{-1} = i.}$ We call ${i}$ the _imaginary unit_,
which is defined by the property ${i^2 = -1.}$ Every real number can be
written as a complex number of the form ${a + bi,}$ where ${a}$ is the real
component and ${bi}$ is the complex component. For example, the real number
${4}$ can be written as ${4 - bi,}$ where ${b = 0.}$ Complex numbers can be
added and subtracted, performing the computations on each part separately.
For example, ${(4 + 3i) - (2 + 8i) = 6 + 11i.}$

Suppose we had the following class:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
class ComplexNumber {
	private:
		int real_component;
		int imaginary_component;
	public:
		ComplexNumber(int r = 0, int i = 0) {
			real_component = r;
			imaginary_component = i;
		}
};
```

With the class above, we can create instances of `ComplexNumber`. Next,
let's include a method for adding complex numbers:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
class ComplexNumber {
	private:
		int realPart;
		int imaginaryPart;
	public:
		ComplexNumber(int r = 0, int i = 0) {
			realPart = r;
			imaginaryPart = i;
		}
		ComplexNumber add(ComplexNumber val) {
			ComplexNumber temp;
			temp.realPart = realPart + val.realPart;
			temp.imaginaryPart = imaginaryPart + val.imaginaryPart;
			return temp;
		}
};
```

Let's add a print method to the class and test:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
class ComplexNumber {
	private:
		int realPart;
		int imaginaryPart;
	public:
		ComplexNumber(int r = 0, int i = 0) {
			realPart = r;
			imaginaryPart = i;
		}
		ComplexNumber add(ComplexNumber val) {
			ComplexNumber temp;
			temp.realPart = realPart + val.realPart;
			temp.imaginaryPart = imaginaryPart + val.imaginaryPart;
			return temp;
		}
		void print() {
			std::cout << realPart << " + " << imaginaryPart << "i" << std::endl;
		}
};

int main() {
	ComplexNumber x = ComplexNumber(2, 3);
	ComplexNumber y = ComplexNumber(5, 8);
	ComplexNumber z = x.add(y);
	z.print();
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
7 + 11i
```

Although the code above works, it would be much more accurate if we could
just use the `+` symbol. This is where operator overloading comes in:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
class ComplexNumber {
	private:
		int realPart;
		int imaginaryPart;
	public:
		ComplexNumber(int r = 0, int i = 0) {
			realPart = r;
			imaginaryPart = i;
		}
		ComplexNumber operator+(ComplexNumber val) {
			ComplexNumber temp;
			temp.realPart = realPart + val.realPart;
			temp.imaginaryPart = imaginaryPart + val.imaginaryPart;
			return temp;
		}
		void print() {
			std::cout << realPart << " + " << imaginaryPart << "i" << std::endl;
		}
};

int main() {
	ComplexNumber x = ComplexNumber(3, 8);
	ComplexNumber y = ComplexNumber(9, 5);
	ComplexNumber z = x + y;
	z.print();
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
12 + 13i
```

Notice the use of `operator+`. This is the syntax for overloading operators
in C++. C++ allows us to overload the following operators:

|       |         |       |         |          |            |
| ----- | ------- | ----- | ------- | -------- | ---------- |
| `+`   | `-`     | `*`   | `/`     | `%`      | `^`        |
| `&`   | `\|`    | `~`   | `!`     | `,`      | `=`        |
| `<`   | `>`     | `<=`  | `>=`    | `++`     | `--`       |
| `<<`  | `>>`    | `==`  | `!=`    | `&&`     | `\|\|`     |
| `+=`  | `-=`    | `/=`  | `%=`    | `^=`     | `&=`       |
| `\|=` | `\*=`   | `<<=` | `>>=`   | `[]`     | `()`       |
| `\_>` | `\_>\*` | `new` | `new[]` | `delete` | `delete[]` |

The following operators _cannot_ be overloaded:

|      |        |
| ---- | ------ |
| `::` | ` .\*` |
| `.`  | `?:`   |

A word of caution on overloading: It's very easy to get carried away
creating new meanings for the symbols above. Overloading is more a matter
of aesthetic and style than anything else. Done poorly, overloading can
lead to poor readability. If we ever catch ourselves overloading an
operator and following it with a comment defining what the operator means,
stop. Operators should be overloaded only if they are intuitive. And by
intuitive, we mean immediately deducible. The example above is intuitive
because it follows the laws of mathematics. It would not be intuitive to
use `++` on a string. What happens when you increment a string? If we ever
find ourselves asking that question, we've ventured into the land of bad
heuristics.
