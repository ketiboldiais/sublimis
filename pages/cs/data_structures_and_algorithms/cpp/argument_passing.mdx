# Argument Passing

When functions have parameters without default values, they must be passed
arguments. In C++, passing arguments into functions can be done in three
ways: (1) **pass-by-value**, (2) **pass-by-reference**, and (3)
**pass-by-address**.

## Pass-by-value

To illustrate these differences, let's consider a canonical function in
programming, `swap()`. Before we write the function, let's recall how the
function works. Say we have an `int a = 0` and an `int b = 1`. To swap the
values assigned to the variables, we create a temporary variable, called
`temp`. Then, we assign to `temp` the variable `a.` Thus, `temp = a = 0.`
Then, we assign to `a` the variable `b.` Thus, `a = b = 1.` Finally, we
assign to `b` the variable `temp`: `b = temp = 0`. The end result: `a = 1`
and `b = 0`. Putting it all together:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int a = 0;
	int b = 1;

	cout << "Before the swap: " << endl;
	cout << "x = " << a << endl;
	cout << "y = " << b << endl;

	// The swap
	int temp;
	temp = a;
	a = b;
	b = temp;

	cout << "After the swap: " << endl;
	cout << "x = " << a << endl;
	cout << "y = " << b << endl;

	return 0;
}
```

```bash
Before the swap:
x = 0
y = 1
After the swap:
x = 1
y = 0
```

Great, it works. Swapping variables, however, is a very common operation.
Accordingly, we want to place this computation in a function, to be used
whenever we'd like:

```cpp
#include <iostream>;
using namespace std;

void swap(int a, int b) { int temp; temp = a; a = b; b = temp; }

int main() { int a = 0; int b = 1;

    cout << "Before the swap: " << endl;
    cout << "x = " << a << endl;
    cout << "y = " << b << endl;

    swap(a, b);

    cout << "After the swap: " << endl;
    cout << "x = " << a << endl;
    cout << "y = " << b << endl;

    return 0;

}

```

```bash
Before the swap:
x = 0
y = 1
After the swap:
x = 0
y = 1
```

Strange. It didn't perform the swap. Why? Because calling functions the way
we did above, `swap(a, b)`, is by default **pass-by-value**. In
pass-by-value, the function only receives a{" "} copy of the values passed.
They are not pass an original. To understand what this implies, recall what
happens in main memory when we execute a function.

When `main()` is loaded, a stack in main memory is allocated for it. Let's
call it _stack main_. Inside _stack main_, memory is allocated for
`int a = 0` and `int b = 1`. Going down the code, we encounter
`swap(a, b)`. This is a new function, so a new stack is created to
accomodate its variables. Call it _stack swap_. Inside _stack swap_, memory
is allocated for `int a`, `int b`, and `temp`. Now, arguments were passed
into `swap()`, so the memory allocated is for `int a = 0`, `int b = 1`, and
`temp`.

Inside _swap stack_, the body of `swap()` works as expected. The variables
do in fact swap. We can see that's true by running the function without
arguments:

```cpp
#include <iostream>;
using namespace std;

void swap(int a = 0, int b = 1) {
	cout << "Before swap: " << endl;
	cout << "\t a = " << a << endl; cout << "\t b = " << b << endl;

    // The swap
    int temp;
    temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;

    cout << "After swap: " << endl;
    cout << "\t a = " << a << endl;
    cout << "\t b = " << b << endl;

}

int main() { swap(); return 0; }

```

```bash
Before swap:
		a = 0
		b = 1
After swap:
		a = 1
		b = 0
```

So what does this all mean? It means that the swap never actually occurs in
the `main()` function. It only occurs in `swap()`, and once `swap()` is
done, _stack swap_ is destroyed. There was no effect whatsoever on the
`int a = 0` and `int b = 1` in _stack main_.

This embodies the concept of pass-by-value. When we simply pass regular
variables into a function, we only pass copies of the values into the
function. We never pass the originals.

Call-by-value is what we use when we want the function to simply return a
result based on the arguments passed. In fact, most of the functions we
write are computations based on arguments. We generally do not want the
original values changed &mdash; we want a new result. For example, suppose
we had a function that computes acceleration:

```cpp
#include <iostream>;
using namespace std;

double acceleration(double velocity1, double velocity2, double time) {
	return (velocity2 - velocity1) / time;
}

int main() { double v1 = 12.4; double v2 = 14.6; double t = 3.48;
	cout << "Before function call:" << endl;
	cout << "v1 = " << v1 << endl;
	cout << "v2 = " << v2 << endl;
	cout << "t = " << t << endl;

	double a = acceleration(v1, v2, t);

	cout << "After function call:" << endl;
	cout << "v1 = " << v1 << endl;
	cout << "v2 = " << v2 << endl;
	cout << "t = " << t << endl;
	cout << "a = " << a << endl;

	return 0;
}

```

```bash
Before function call:
v1 = 12.4
v2 = 14.6
t = 3.48
After function call:
v1 = 12.4
v2 = 14.6
t = 3.48
a = 0.632184
```

We obtained a value, but we did not modify the actual arguments, `v1`,
`v2`, and `t`. In programming, we want to minimize mutation as much as
possible. Pass-by-value is one means of ensuring that. But what if we do
want mutation? I.e., what if we truly want to modify the actual arguments,
like how we intended in `swap()`?

## Pass-by-address

One way to do so is with **pass-by-address**. Pass-by-address is exactly
what it sounds like. Instead of sending copies of the values to a function,
we send the address of the values:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void swap(int *a, int *b) { int temp; temp = *a; *a = *b; *b = temp; }

int main() { int a = 0; int b = 1;
	cout << "Before the swap: " << endl;
	cout << "x = " << a << endl;
	cout << "y = " << b << endl;

	swap(&a, &b);

	cout << "After the swap: " << endl;
	cout << "x = " << a << endl;
	cout << "y = " << b << endl;

	return 0;
}

```

```bash
Before the swap:
x = 0
y = 1
After the swap:
x = 1
y = 0
```

Now it works. But how? Notice that with the function call `swap()`, we
passed as arguments `&a` and `&b`. These are the addresses of `a` and `b`
in `main()`. Then, inside `swap()`, the parameters are `*a` and `*b`. These
are pointers. Why are they pointers? Because if we want to store memory
addresses, we must use pointers. Accordingly, inside the body of `swap()`,
we use pointers to perform the swap. Those pointers always refer to the
addresses of `a` and `b` in `main()`.

## Pass-by-reference

Recall that we can think of a _reference_ as a nickname, or pseudonym, for
a variable. That nickname, or pseudonym, can be passed as an argument to a
function. Passing references as arguments to a function is called
**pass-by-reference**. For example, using our code above:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void swap(int &a, int &b) { int temp; temp = a; a = b; b = temp; }

int main() { int a = 0; int b = 1;
	cout << "Before the swap: " << endl;
	cout << "x = " << a << endl;
	cout << "y = " << b << endl;

	swap(a, b);

	cout << "After the swap: " << endl;
	cout << "x = " << a << endl;
	cout << "y = " << b << endl;

	return 0;
}

```

```bash
Before the swap:
x = 0
y = 1
After the swap:
x = 1
y = 0
```

The same result from passing by address is obtained. This is because we
employed **pass-by-reference**. When `main()` is memory is allocated for
its variables, as usual. However, the distinction is when the loader
encounters `swap(a, b)`. The formal parameters of `a` and `b` are `&a` and
`&b`.

What happens when these parameters are used? The entire definition for
`swap()` is &#8220;copied-and-pasted&#8221; into the body of `main()`. In
other words, `swap()` isn't loaded separately from `main()`. It is loaded
as a part of `main()`. And because `swap()` is a part of `main()`, `swap()`
can effectively &#8220;see&#8221;, or has access, to the preceding
variables inside `main()`. In practice, pass-by-reference is used far more
often than pass-by-address. Why? Because it's simpler to write and easier
to read.

## Pass-by-reference v. Pass-by-value

To repeat, the default approach for passing arguments into functions in C++
is pass-by-value. A fair question is when should we avoid the default
approach; i.e., pass-by-reference. Answer: It depends.

When we pass-by-value, we pass a copy of the value. This has the benefit of
avoiding inadvertent mutability. It also leads to code that's easier to
prove or reason about. The cost, however, is inefficiency. If a function
takes a large data structure as an argument, it's worth considering whether
we actually want to pass that argument by value. With pass-by-value, an
entire copy of that data structure must be made, and this takes up both
memory and processing power.

If the data structure is particularly large, then it's like that case that
we want to pass-by-reference. This avoids the computational expense of
generating a copy of that data structure.

Of course, we should also consider whether we should be passing the entire
data structure in the first place. If only a part of that data structure is
needed by a function, we should be passing only part of that data structure
as an argument. If that part is particularly small, then we should err on
the side of passing by value.

In general, pass-by-reference is a convenient feature in C++, but it can be
easily abused. From a big-picture perspective, references should only be
used when there's some value in the program that every other module in the
program depends on. Because of that dependancy, it's necessary to change
that value for everyone else, because those changes impact what everyone
else does.
