# Header Files in C++

Enapsulation. The idea of **eancapsulation** is that user defined types
have two layers: (1) an _interface_ and (2) an _implementation_. The
interface is how the world accesses the type, and the implementation is how
the type operates or works. These two layers are defined in separate files.
For example, suppose we have a user-defined type called `cube`. The
interface is kept in a file called `cube.h` (a _header file_), and the
implementation in a file called `cube.cpp` (a _code file_). Inside
`cube.h`, we have the following:

```cpp
// The Cube.h file

#pragma once

class Cube {
	public:
	// These are the functions we can use with this type
		double getVolume();
		double getSurfaceArea();
		double getSize();

	private:
	// This is the data stored by this type
		double side_;

};
```

The line `#pragma once` tells the compiler that the following code should
be used once during compilation. We include this line because our code
might have a header file that relies on another header file that relies on
another header file. This raises the danger of a possibly never-ending loop
of searching for header files. `#pragma once` ensures that loop terminates.
We call statements like `#pragma once` **include guards**.

Because these materials assume some knowledge of object-oriented
programming, we address `public` and `private` in brief. The symbols
`public` and `private` operate the same way as they would in other OOP
languages like Java &mdash; `public`, anyone and anything has access to the
variable or method; `private`, the particular variable or method is
accessible only to the class. In `C++`, if no access modifier is explicitly
stated, the variable or method is `private` by default.

With the functions and data above, we now need to actually define them in
our `Cube.cpp` file:

```cpp
// The Cube.cpp file

#include "Cube.h"

double Cube::getVolume() {

}
```

The line `#include "Cube.h"` tells the compiler, "Find the file called
`Cube.h`, and copy it to this file." This is because the compiler must know
how the interface works to compile `Cube.cpp`. It can only do so if we
insert `#include "Cube.h"` into the file. Notice how the code in the header
file corresponds to the code in source code file:

```cpp
// The Cube.h file

class Cube {
	public:
		double getVolume();
}

// The Cube.cpp file
#include "Cube.h"

double Cube::getVolume() {

}
```

Notice the `::`. This is called the **scope resolution operator**. This
operator says, place `Cube` in front of `getVolume()`. Because
`getVolume()` is a _member function_ &mdash; i.e., a **method** &mdash; we
must inform the compiler what class `getVolume()` belongs to. This is done
with the scope resolution operator, `::`(two colons).

Why do we have to tell the compiler which class this method belongs to?
Because in `Cube.h`, we might have a function called `getVolume()` in other
classes that are not `Cube`.

```cpp
// The Cube.h file

class Cube {
	public:
		double getVolume();
}

class Sphere {
	public:
		double getVolum();
}


// The Cube.cpp file

#include "Cube.h"

double Cube::getVolume() {

}

double Sphere::getVolume() {

}
```

Let's write some `return` statements for `Cube::getVolume()` method.

```cpp
#include "Cube.h"

double Cube::getVolume() {
	return side_ * side_ * side_;
}
```
