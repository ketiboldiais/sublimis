# Variable Scope

Functions are good point for us to switch gears and discuss **variable
scope**. Generally, there are kinds of scope: (1) the **global scope** and
(2) a **local scope**. Consider the following code:

```cpp
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int a = 1;

bool isEven(int n) {
	return (n % 2 == 0);
}

int main() {
	int x = 0;
	cout << x << endl;
	x += a;
	if (isEven(x)) {
		cout << x << " is even." << endl;
	} else {
		cout << x << " is not even." << endl;
	}

	return 0;
}
```

```bash
0
1 is not even.
```

In the code above, we have two functions, `main()` and `isEven()`. Outside
of these functions, we have `int a = 1`. This is a _global variable_.
Inside `main()`, we have the variable `int x = 0`. This is a _local
variable_ (more specifically, a variable _local to_ `main`). Inside both
`main()` and `isEven()`, we have access to `int a`. This is because `int a`
is a global variable &mdash; it's a variable that can be &#8220;seen&#8221;
by all the functions following it.

Recall that when we load a function in memory, each function's variables
are allocated memory in a stack. Those stacks are popped off (i.e., the
variables are destroyed) once the function finishes executing. This rule is
true only for local variables (and function variables are local to the
function). The rule is not true for global variables. Global variables
exist in memory so long as the program continues running. Where do they
exist? Not in the stack or the heap. Instead, they are allocated memory in
the code section, where they stay as long as our program runs.

## Block Level Scope

In addition to the global and local distinction, C++ also distinguishes
scopes with block levels. A simple rule for block level scope: During
compilation, C++ can see the variables to the left, but not variables to
the right. For example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int x = 1;

int main() {
	int x = 2;
	{
		int x = 3;
		cout << "x (from block): " << x << endl;
		cout << "Global x (from block): " << ::x << endl;
	}
	cout << "x (from main): " << x << endl;
	cout << "Global x (from main): " << ::x << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
x (from block): 3
Global x (from block): 1
x (from main): 2
Global x (from main): 1
```

The `::` operator is called the **scope resolution operator**. It allows us
to access a particular global variable when we have a variable with the
same name locally.
