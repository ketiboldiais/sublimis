# Overflow

A value of type `$1` takes 1 byte of memory. Consider the output for the
following code:

```cpp
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
	char x = 127;
	cout << (int)x << endl;
	x++;
	cout << (int)x << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
127
-128
```

Strange. By incrementing `x` by 1, the value went from 127 to 128. This
demonstrates the concept of `$1`. A character can store only 1 byte. This
means a value of type `$1` can only represent numeric values in the range
${[127, -128].}$ So what happens when we go beyond 127 or -128? We move to
the beginning or the end of the range.

We can think of this like a clock. We start at 0, then go up to 127. After
127 is -128, then -127, then -126, all the way up to 0 and all way up
to 127. It's cyclical. But why is it cyclical?

Because the numbers are represented as bits. The number 127 is represented
as `01111111`. When we increment by 1, we get: `10000000`, `-128` in the
decimal system. This is just binary addition. The first bit is the sign, 0
for positive, and 1 for negative.
