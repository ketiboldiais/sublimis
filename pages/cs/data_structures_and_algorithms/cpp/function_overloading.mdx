# Function Overloading

Notice that the three functions, `print()`, have the same name, but they
compile just fine:

```cpp
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
#define SIZEOF(a) sizeof(a)/sizeof(*a)

void print(int arr[], int length);
void print(char arr[], int length);
void print(double arr[], int length);

int main() {
	int intArr[]{1, 2, 3, 4};
	char charArr[]{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'};
	double doubleArr[]{1.2, 2.9, 3.1, 3.10};

	print(intArr, SIZEOF(intArr));
	print(charArr, SIZEOF(charArr));
	print(doubleArr, SIZEOF(doubleArr));
	return 0;
}

void print(int arr[], int length) {
	for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
		cout << arr[i] << " ";
	}
	cout << endl;
}

void print(char arr[], int length) {
	for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
		cout << arr[i] << " ";
	}
	cout << endl;
}

void print(double arr[], int length) {
	for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
		cout << arr[i] << " ";
	}
	cout << endl;
}
```

```bash
1 2 3 4
a b c d
1.2 2.9 3.1 3.1
```

This is an example of **function overloading** &mdash; the phenomenon of
when different functions performing different tasks, have the same
identifier. More abstractly, we can think of it as if the function &mdash;
an operator &mdash; can perform multiple tasks. In C++, we can accomplish
function overloading by either (a) having different type parameters, (b)
having a different number of parameters. In general, to accomplish function
overloading, we have to provide C++ a way to differentiate between the
functions. In the example of `print()`, this is done by providing different
arguments.

Things that will not work, on their own, for differentiating: Return type,
the order the functions are written, and default parameters. Using these
differences alone are insufficient to allowing C++ to differentiate the
functions, resulting in a **name conflict**.

Function overloading is tremendously useful. One of the hardest tasks in
programming is naming things, made all the more difficult when we have
functions that perform something very similar &mdash; like printing an
array to the console &mdash; but differ by just one or two things, such as
argument type. However, as with all features, there are tradeoffs.

Function overloading is a kind of _polymorphism_, a topic we will discuss
further in later sections. In a nutshell, polymorphism is when we have an
entity of a particular type behaving like something else of a particular
type. For example, a person's dog can behave like a loving friend. Yet in
other situations, a vicious guard. The same idea &mdash; and risk &mdash;
applies to overloaded functions. We must always be cognizant of what our
functions are capable of doing, just as a dog owner should be cognizant of
when and where their dogs are a danger to others. If a function is
overloaded with too many tasks, we risk losing track of what the function
does when passed certain arguments. A similar risk occurs when we overload
a function with tasks that don't intuitively correspond to the identifier.
For example, it would be a poor choice to allow `print()` to average the
elements of an `int` array &mdash; it's not clear how averaging something
relates to `print`.
