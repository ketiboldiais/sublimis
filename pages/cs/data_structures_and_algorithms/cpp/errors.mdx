# Errors

Errors are unexpected or unintended program results. They fall into four
categories: (1) **compiler errors**; (2) **linker errors**; (3) **runtime
errors**; and (4) **logic errors**. We cover them briefly below.

### Compiler Errors

Like a human language, any given programming language has specific rules
for how we write and use the language. These rules fall into two sets: (a)
**syntax** and (b) **semantics**. A language's syntax is the set of all
rules defining how meaning should be conveyed (in other words, how we can
_write_ in the language). A language's semantics is the set of all rules
defining when there is _meaning_. For example, below are all syntax errors.

```cpp
// We neglected to terminate the string (forgetting a quotation * mark).
//  And neglected to include a semicolon.

std::cout << "errors << std::endl
```

Next, semantic errors:

```cpp
// We told the compiler that main() returns an int.
// But then we're returning a string (a char*).
// We also omitted the opening brace.
// This will confuse the compiler; where does the code start and end?
int main()
	return "Hello, world!"
}
```

When we violate these rules &mdash; syntax and semantics &mdash; we receive
a **compiler error**. Syntax errors are relatively easy to fix. The
compiler will usually pinpoint the particular line where the error
occurred. Semantics errors are a little more difficult, but they should be
easy to spot as long as we have a good understanding of semantic rules.

Alternatively, the compiler may return a **compiler warning** rather than a
compiler error. The difference is that the source will still compile, but
there is an inordinate amount of risk in doing so. A rule of thumb: Treat
compiler warnings as if they are errors.

### Linker Errors

The process of **linking** is when the _linker_ attempts to piece together
all of the difference parts of the program in preparation for execution. If
the linker has trouble linking the program's object files together, we will
receive a **linker error**. The most common culprit behind linker errors: A
missing library or object file. Usually, this happens when we use an
incorrect file path or incorrect name.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

extern int phi;

int main() {
	std::cout<<x;
	return 0;
}
```

The code above will compile just fine, but it will return a linker error.
Why? Because we are using some `int` named `phi`, that supposedly exists
outside the source code. The problem? There is no file in the directory
that contains, let alone defines, what `int phi` is. Because the linker
cannot find the necessary pieces, it returns a linker error. Linker errors
most commonly occur when we use many libraries and external source code
files, and they are trickier to fix. We will address them as they arise.

### Runtime Errors

Runtime errors are errors that occur when the program executes. Alongside
logic errors, runtime errors are some of the most difficult to resolve.
This is because they've managed to evade the compiler and the linker, and
as such, there's something much more sinister occurring. The most common
culprits: dividing by zero (C++ is not among the languages that ascribes a
value for dividing by zero), memory leaks (running out of memory, leading
to either a crash or very slow execution), segmentation faults (touching
memory we shouldn't be touching), stack or heap overflows (e.g., recursive
functions that never or take too long to reach a base case), hangings
(infinite loops), and file-not-found errors. Because runtime errors come in
many forms, we will address them as they occur. As a preface, they are best
handled with exceptions.

### Logic Errors

Logic errors are without a doubt the most difficult errors to fix. This is
where there is not something wrong with our code: The code builds and
executes with no problems, but we're seeing unexpected results. The problem
is not in the code, but in our thinking. Like runtime errors, logic errors
are best addressed as they occur, because they come in many forms &mdash;
fence-post problems, exponential recursions, untraveled branches, and many
more. For these kinds of errors, debuggers and test suites are extremely
helpful.
