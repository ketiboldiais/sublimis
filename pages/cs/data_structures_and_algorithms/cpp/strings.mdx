# Strings in C++

In C++, there are two approaches to represent strings: (1) as an array of
`char` values; or (2) as an instance of the class `string`. In C++, the
second approach is preferred.[^stringnote]

[^stringnote]:
    The first approach, representing strings as an array of character
    values, originates in the C language. It is how strings are represented
    in C, and because C++ is a superset of C, the same approach can be
    applied in C++.

## Character Arrays

Applying the first approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void printString(char arr[], int n);
int main() {
	char greet[] = "Hello world!";
	cout << greet << endl;

	return 0;
}
```

```
	Hello world!
```

Notice the use of square bracket syntax to denote an array of `char`. An
important point to notice about character arrays is their size. Recalling
the fact that a `char` type takes 1 byte, consider this output:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void printString(char arr[], int n);
int main() {
	char greet[] = "Hello world!";
	int sizeOf_greet = sizeof(greet);
	cout << "size of greet = " << sizeOf_greet << " bytes" << endl;

	return 0;
}
```

```bash
	size of greet = 13 bytes
```

The array `greet` consists of 12 elements (there are 12 characters in
&#8220;Hello world!&#8221;). Why are we seeing 13 bytes as the size of
`greet`? Because every character array, denoted as a string, takes one
extra byte, reserved for `\0`. This value, `\0`, is called the **null
byte**, or more specifically, the **string delimiter**. It is the byte at
the very end of the array, placed there to indicate the end of an array of
characters, a string.[^stringnote]

[^stringnote]:
    Note that not every character array is a string. The array
    `{'b', 'y', 'e'}` is a `char` array, but it is not a string. However,
    once we include the string delimiter, it is considered a string:
    `{'b', 'y', 'e', '\0'}`.

## Reading & Writing Character Arrays.

We can read and write `char` arrays with `cin` and `cout`. The catch,
however, is that we must indicate the size of the character array. This can
lead to wasted space, but we will address this problem later.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void printString(char arr[], int n);
int main() {
	char name[20];
	cout << "What's your name?" << endl;
	cin >> name;
	cout << "Hello, " << name << "." << endl;

	return 0;
}
```

```bash
	What's your name?
	Dorian
	Hello, Dorian.
```

The problem with the approach above, however, is that it will not read
anything after a whitespace:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void printString(char arr[], int n);
int main() {
	char name[20];
	cout << "What's your name?" << endl;
	cin >> name;
	cout << "Hello, " << name << "." << endl;

	return 0;
}
```

```bash
	What's your name?
	Dorian Gray
	Hello, Dorian.
```

To fix this, we need to use `cin.get`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void printString(char arr[], int n);
int main() {
	char name[20];
	cout << "What's your name?" << endl;
	cin.get(name, 20);
	cout << "Hello, " << name << "." << endl;

	return 0;
}
```

```
What's your name?
Dorian Gray
Hello, Dorian Gray.
```

Notice the syntax for `cin.get()`. We must pass into it the variable we
want to store the input in, and the number of characters to be read. With
`cin.get()`, if we pass in 20 for the number of characters, the number of
characters to be read is actually 19, with 1 for the null byte.

If we want multiple string inputs from the user, we use `cin.getline()`.
This is a separate function for reading strings because `cin.get()` does
not differentiate between different `enter` key inputs. If we do want to
use `cin.get()`, we should separate the different `cin.get()` calls with a
`cin.ignore()`. Of course, it is much easier to just use `cin.getline()`
whenever we seek multiple inputs from the user.

## Functions on Strings

C++ provides several string functions through `string.h`, a header file, or
alternatively, through `cstring`. These are both libraries providing
various operations we can perform on strings.

### Finding a String's Length

Without the aforementioned libraries, one way to find a string's length is
with the `sizeof()` operator:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	char greet[] = "Foo bar baz bang";
	int sizeOfGreet = sizeof(greet) - 1;
	cout << "size of greet = " << sizeOfGreet << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```
	size of greet = 16
```

We subtract 1 because there is 1 extra element in the array, reserved for
the null byte. Alternatively, we can simply use the `strlen()` method
provided by `cstring`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	char greet[] = "Foo bar baz bang";
	int sizeOfGreet = strlen(greet);
	cout << "size of greet = " << sizeOfGreet << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```
size of greet = 16
```

Notice the syntax for `strlen()`. We simply pass in the variable storing
the string, or the string itself, we seek the length for.

## Concatenating Strings

When we **concatenate** two strings, we merge the strings together. We can
concatenate strings with the `strcat()` method:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	char foo[] = "John ";
	char bar[] = "Kim";
	strcat(foo, bar);
	cout << foo << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```
John Kim
```

The syntax for `strcat()` is as follows:

> `strcat(destination, source)`

Where `destination` is the string to be merged on to (here `foo`), and
`source` is the string to merge (here `bar`).

To understand how concatenation works, examine the array of characters:

```cpp
array1 = ['J', 'o', 'h', 'n', ' ', '\0'];
array2 = ['K', 'i', 'm', '\0'];
```

When we concatenate `Kim` onto `John`, we take the first character of `Kim`
&mdash; `K` &mdash; and use it to replace the null byte of `John`. If we
want to concatenate only some characters in the source string, we use
`strncat()`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	char x[] = "Big ";
	char y[] = "Apple";
	strncat(x, y, 3);
	cout << x << endl;

	return 0;
}
```

```
Big App
```

### Copying Strings

With the functions above, we mutated an existing string. What if we do not
want to mutate an existing string? For that, we need the ability to copy
strings. We can do so with `strcpy()`. The general syntax:

> `strcpy(destination, source)`

For example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	char x[] = "Hello";
	int sizeOfx = sizeof(x);
	char z[sizeOfx];
	char y[] = " world!";
	strcpy(z, x);
	strcat(z, y);
	cout << "x: " << x << endl;
	cout << "z: " << z << endl;

	return 0;
}
```

```
x: Hello
z: Hello world!
```

Notice that we did not mutate `x`. This is because we made a copy of the
string stored in `x`, and stored that copy in `z`.

## Substrings

Another useful feature to have when working with strings is determining
whether a given string is a substring of another string. For example, the
string &#8220;corn&#8221; is a substring of the string &#8220;acorn.&#8221;
We can make this determination with `strstr()`. The general syntax:

> `strstr(main, substring)`

In the syntax above, `main` is the existing string, and `substring` is the
substring we want to check for. An example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	char x[] = "Apple pie";
	bool result = strstr(x, "Apple");
	cout << result << endl;

	return 0;
}
```

```
	1
```

We get back `1`, indicating `"Apple"` is a substring of the string
`"Apple pie"`. Remember that upper and lowercase characters are different.
Checking for the substring `"apple"` will return `0`.

If we want to find an instance of a `char`, we use `strchar()`. The general
syntax:

> `strchr(string, char)`

The function `strchr()` will search for a given character starting from the
left. If we want to find a given character from the right, we use
`strrchar()`.

## Comparing Strings

In some languages, we can compare strings with the `<` or `>` operators.
These operations output which of the given strings appears first in the
alphabet. C++ provides a similar function, `strcmp()`.[^strcmpnote] The
general syntax:

[^strcmpnote]:
    &#8220;strcmp&#8221; is a clipping of &#8220;string compare.&#8221;

> `strcmp(s1, s2)`

Where `s1` and `s2` are the strings to be compared. For example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	char apple[] = "apple";
	char kiwi[] = "kiwi";
	char peach[] = "peach";

	int result1 = strcmp(apple, kiwi);
	int result2 = strcmp(peach, apple);
	int result3 = strcmp(peach, peach);

	cout << "result1 = " << result1 << endl;
	cout << "result2 = " << result2 << endl;
	cout << "result3 = " << result3 << endl;

	return 0;
}
```

```bash
result1 = -10
result2 = 15
result3 = 0
```

Let's examine this output. First, `strcmp(s1, s2)` returns either a
negative, 0, or positive value. If ${s_1}$ comes before ${s_2}$ in the
alphabet, the value returned is negative. If ${s_1}$ comes after ${s_2}$ in
the alphabet, the value returns positive. Finally, if both ${s_1}$ and
${s_2}$ are the same, the value returned is 0.

How does `strcmp()` work? It compares the ACII integer values of the first
non-matching character. For example, with `apple` and `kiwi`, the first
non-matching characters are `a` and `k`. The character `a` has an ASCII
value of 97, and the character `k` has an ASCII value of `107`. Thus,
`apple` is different from `kiwi` by -10 in terms in ASCII value.

### String to Number

Suppose we have the following strings:

```cpp
	#include <iostream>
	#include <cstring>
	using namespace std;

	int main() {
		char num1[] = "157";
		char num2[] = "2.49";

		return 0;
	}
```

Strings containing numbers are common in programming. So much so that C++
provides functions for converting a string of numbers into a numeric type.
These functions are `strtol()` and `strtof()`.[^clippingnote] The function
`strtolong()` will convert a number string into a `long int`, and
`strtof()` will convert a number string into a `float`.

[^clippingnote]:
    `strtol()` is a clipping of &#8220;string to long&#8221; and `strtof()`
    is a clipping of &#8220;string to float.&#8221;

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#include <typeinfo>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	char num1[] = "157";
	char num2[] = "2.49";
	long int x = strtol(num1, NULL, 10);
	float y = strtof(num2, NULL);

	cout << typeid(num1).name() << " num1 : " << num1 << endl;
	cout << typeid(num2).name() << " num2 : " << num2 << endl;
	cout << typeid(x).name() << " x : " << x << endl;
	cout << typeid(y).name() << " y : " << y << endl;

	return 0;
}
```
```
A4_c num1 : 157 A5_c num2 : 2.49 l x : 157 f y : 2.49
```

Notice how the types have changed. The function `strtol()` takes three
arguments: (1) the string we wish to convert; (2) `NULL`; and (3) the base
for the relevant number system (e.g., 10 for the decimal systemm; 2 for the
binary system; 16 for hexadecimalese; etc.). The `strtof()` function takes
the same arguments, but without the need for a number system parameter.

### Tokenizing

Consider the following string:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	char userInput[] = "Hello world";

	return 0;
}
````

Can we separate the string `userInput` into the smaller strings `"Hello"`
and `"world"`? Yes, we can. The process of breaking down a string into
smaller pieces is called **tokenizing**. The term &#8220;tokenizing&#8221;
comes from the fact that every string consists of discrete parts. For
example, the string `"Hello world"` consists of the tokens `"Hello"` and
`"world"`. Tokens are defined according to some common separator. For
example, in `"Hello world"` the separator is a whitespace.

To tokenize a string in C++, we use the `strtok()` function. The general
syntax:

> `strtok( `${s_1}$`, `${d}$`)`

Where ${s_1}$ is the string to tokenize, and ${d}$ is the delimiter, or
separator

For example, let's tokenize the string `userInput`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	char userInput[] = "Hello world";
	char *substr = strtok(userInput, " ");
	cout << substr << endl;

	return 0;
}
```

```bash
	Hello
```

We managed to extract `Hello`, but what about `world`? This is the expected
behavior for `strtok()`. With only the arguments we passed into `strtok()`,
C++ will only extract the first token. To extract all the tokens, we will
need to run `strtok()` repeatedly. In other words, we must use a loop.
Let's use a while loop, and store the respective tokens into a string
array:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

void printStringArray(char *arr[], int n);

int main() {
	char str[] = "Hello world";
	char *token = strtok(str, " ");
	char *tokenArr[2];
	int i = 0;
	while (token != NULL) {
		tokenArr[i] = token;
		token = strtok(NULL, " ");
		i++;
	}

	printStringArray(tokenArr, 2);
	// we can then index into the array
	cout << tokenArr[0] << endl;
	cout << tokenArr[1] << endl;

	return 0;
}

void printStringArray(char *arr[], int n) {
	cout << "[ ";
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cout << arr[i] << "  ";
	}
	cout << "]" << endl;
}
```

```bash
	[ Hello  world ]
	Hello
	world
```
