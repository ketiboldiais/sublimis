# Object Transformation

To **transform** an object is to modify some property of the object.
Transformation is the first step towards _animating_ the object. In
ThreeJS, the four properties most relevant to transformation are:

<Tile>
	<div>- `position` - `scale`</div>
	<div>- `rotation` - `quaternion`</div>
</Tile>

All of these properties originate in a class called `Object3D.` From the
`Object3D` class we have classes like `PerspectiveCamera` and `Mesh`.

## The Position Property

As stated earlier, the `position` property originates in the class
`Object3D`. Thus, any object whose ancestor class is `Object3D` has a
`position` property. The `position` property itself is a combination of
three properties:

1. `Obj.x` Sets the 洧논-axis coordinate.
2. `Obj.y` Sets the 洧녽-axis coordinate.
3. `Obj.z` Sets the 洧녾-axis coordinate.

To illustrate, we'll use our cube from the previous section:

```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(mesh);
const sizes = {
	width: 800;
	height: 800;
}
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
	75,
	sizes.width / sizes.height
)
camera.position.z = 3; // move the camera back
scene.add(camera);
const canvas = document.querySelector('.webgl');
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
	canvas: canvas;
});
renderer.setSize(sizes.width, sizes.height);
renderer.render(scene, camera);
```

As we saw, this results in:

Now let's write:

```javascript
mesh.position.y = 1; // move the mesh up by 1

mesh.position.x = 1; // move the mesh right by 1

mesh.position.z = 1; // move the mesh forward by 1
```

the render:

We can also update all three positions in a single line:

```javascript
mesh.position.set(1, 1, 1);
```

When using the single-line approach, the syntax is:

- `Obj.position.set(洧논, 洧녽, 洧녾)`

Note that this works because we're using a perspective camera. Interpreting
the axes entirely depends on the camera; the camera establishes _our_
position when we view the object. If we think about this carefully, this
makes perfect sense. The word &#8220;right&#8221; and &#8220;left&#8221;
are entirely subjective. It's why questions like &#8220;My left or your
left?&#8221; exist.

The same goes for &#8220;up&#8221; and &#8220;down.&#8221; If van Helsing
stands on the floor while Dracula suspends from the ceiling, Helsing's
&#8220;down&#8221; is Dracula's &#8220;up,&#8221; and Dracula's
&#8220;up&#8221; is Helsing's &#8220;down.&#8221; The words
&#8220;forward&#8221; and &#8220;backward&#8221; are not immune either. If
Don Quixote stands in front of a car and the car reverses towards Panza,
the car is moving &#8220;backward&#8221; from Don Quixote and
&#8220;forward&#8221; towards Panza.

Equally arbitrary is the number we used above, `1.` The distance of ${1}$
unit is entirely determined by our interpretation. We can think of it was 1
nanometer, 1 meter, 1 mile, 1 lightyear, and so on. As stated in the
earlier section, distances in ThreeJS are measured in terms of proportions.
Thus, once we've settled on an interpretation, we must keep that
interpretation in mind when we use numbers for other objects.

The `position` property also inherits from a class called Vector3. The
`Vector3` class contains numerous methods we will use extensively. One such
method is `.length()`:

```javascript
mesh.position.x = 0.7;
mesh.position.y = -0.6;
mesh.position.z = 1;
console.log(mesh.position.length());
```

```bash
1.3601470508735443
```

The output above is effectively how far our mesh is from the scene's
center. We can also obtain the distance between the object and the camera
(note that there must be a camera before we ask for the distance to the
camera):

```javascript
mesh.position.x = 0.7;
mesh.position.y = -0.6;
mesh.position.z = 1;

// after the camera initialization

console.log(mesh.position.distanceTo(camera.position));
```

```bash
2.202271554554524
```

Another particularly useful method is `normalize()`. This method will take
the length of a particular vector, and reduce it to a length of `1`. For
example, suppose we manipulated the mesh's position as follows:

```javascript
mesh.position.x = 0.7;
mesh.position.y = -0.6;
mesh.position.z = 1;

mesh.position.normalize();
```

when we write:

```javascript
mesh.position.normalize();
```

## Axes Helper

Because axes can get confusing when working with many different cameras,
ThreeJS provides a tool called `AxesHelper`. This is just a visualization
of the axes we're working with. To create it, we write the code below. Note
that because the axes helper is an object, it must be added to the scene:

```javascript
const axesHelper = new THREE.AxesHelper();
scene.add(axesHelper);
```

With the axes helper, the axes are color-coded, each with a length of 1
unit:

1. The red line corresponds to the 洧논-axis.
2. The green line corresponds to the 洧녽-axis.
3. The blue line corresponds to the 洧녾-axis.

With the perspective camera set to default, we likely do not see the 洧녾-axis
line. This is because the perspective camera, by default, points straight
ahead. To see the 洧녾-axis we must change the camera position:

```javascript
const axesHelper = new THREE.AxesHelper();
scene.add(axesHelper);

// camera initialized

camera.position.x = 1;
camera.position.y = 1;
camera.position.z = 3;
scene.add(camera);
```

the result:

## Scale

Like the position property, the `scale` property is also a `Vector3`. The
`scale` property will change the scale (i.e., the unit proportions) of the
particular object. For example, the default value of each axis is ${1.}$ We
can change this default value by modifying the `scale` property:

```javascript
mesh.scale.x = 2; // change the x-axis scale to 2
mesh.scale.y = 3; // change the y-axis scale to 3
mesh.scale.z = 0.5; // change the z-axis scale to 0.5
```

## Rotating Objects

To rotate objects, we have two properties available for modification:

1. `rotation`
2. `quaternion`

Modifying either of the properties above will achieve a rotation.
Importantly, updating one will update the other. Let's first consider the
`rotation` property.

With `rotation`, there three properties:

- `rotation.x`, which sets the 洧논-axis angle in radians, the default being
  ${0.}$
- `rotation.y`, which sets the 洧녽-axis angle in radians, the default being
  ${0.}$
- `rotation.z`, which sets the 洧녾-axis angle in radians, the default being
  ${0.}$

Each of these properties inherits from a class called `Euler`. The idea
behind `rotation` is that the object rotates about a stick piercing through
the center of the object. Thus, when we use the `rotation` property, we
must think about which axis we're rotating the object on (i.e., from which
direction the stick pierces through the object).

Stating the rotations follows the usual dot notation:

```javascript
mesh.rotation.x = 0.5; // rotate about the x-axis
mesh.rotation.y = 0.5; // rotate about the y-axis
mesh.rotation.z = 0.5; // rotate about the z-axis
```

we get:

Because the rotations are measured in radians, a rotation value of ${\pi}$
results in rotation equivalent to ${{180}^\circ,}$ and a value of ${2 \pi}$
results in a full revolution, ${{360}^\circ.}$

```javascript
// rotate about the y-axis half a circle
mesh.rotation.y = Math.pi;

// rotate about the z-axis a full circle
mesh.rotation.z = 2 * MATH.pi;
```

The code above yields:

## Gimbal Lock

We must take care when working with rotations. Whenever we rotate an axis,
we might unintentionally rotate the other axis. This is because the
`rotation` property always follows the order `x`, `y`, and `z`. Consider
the illustration above. If we rotate the object about the 洧녾-axis by
${\pi / 2,}$ the 洧녽- and 洧녾-axes point in different directions:

Moreover, because these axes are arbitrary (it depends on the camera's
position), we can mistakenly rotate, say, the 洧논-axis when we actually
intended to rotate the 洧녽-axis If we rotate an axis far enough, we can get
into a situation called a **gimbal lock** &mdash; a phenomenon where it
appears as if one of the axes is stuck, or doesn't work anymore.

One way to avoid this problem is to change the default order with the
`.reorder()` method:

```javascript
// change the rotation order to y-, x-, z-axis
mesh.rotation.reorder("yxz");
// rotations
```

The last comment above is included to indicate that the reordering must
occur before we rotate.

As we can likely tell, it seems tedious to have to write these reorderings
over and over again before rotations. Because of this nuisance, ThreeJS
provides another property for rotation, `quaternion`. We will cover
quaternions in a later section, but the idea behind the quaternion is that
we can use some algebra to ensure rotations are consistent. Because the
mathematics is fairly involved, we will devote an entire section for
quaternions in a later discussion.

## Look at a Particular Point

When working with transformations, it's often helpful to keep the camera
pointed at a particular point. This way, no matter how we transform the
object, the camera points at a constant location, allowing us some
uniformity in evaluating transformations. To do so, we use `lookAt()`, a
method available to all `Object3D` instances (e.g., cameras):

```javascript
// initialize camera
camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector(0, -1, 0));
```

By writing the code above, the camera will always point at the coordinate
${(0, -1, 0).}$ This coordinate, however, may or may not be on the mesh. If
we wanted to keep the camera pointed at the mesh, we can use the mesh's
position property:

```javascript
// initialize camera and mesh
camera.lookAt(mesh.position);
```

With the above code, the camera now always points to the center of the
mesh.

## Grouping

From our discussion thus far, it should be obvious that transforming
objects can lead to many lines of code. Because of this fact, it's best
practice to _group_ objects whenever possible. For example, 3D rendering of
a house might consist of many component 3D renderings &mdash; the rendering
for a door, a table, the walls, a roof, and so on. If the house is just one
rendering in a bigger rendering of, say, a landscape, we do not want to
have to move each of the component renderings one-by-one. Instead, we
should gather all of these component renderings into a group, then
manipulate the properties for that group. If we want to move the house to
another position in the landscape, we manipulate the position property for
the house, rather than the position property for the walls, roof, table,
lamp, and so on.

To make a group, we use the `group()` method:

```javascript
// create two cubes
const cube1 = new THREE.mesh(
	new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1),
	new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 }),
);
const cube2 = new THREE.mesh(
	new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1),
	new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 }),
);

// create the group
const group1 = new Three.Group();

// add the cubes to the group
group1.add(cube1, cube2);

// add the group to the scene
scene.add(group1);
```

Notice that we used slightly different syntax to instantiate the meshes. We
can directly pass the properties into the constructor. Importantly, we must
remember to always add our groups to the scene. Otherwise, we won't see
anything displayed.

With the two cubes in a group, we can transform them all together by
transforming the group:

```javascript
group.position.y = 1; // move the group by 1 on the y-axis
```
