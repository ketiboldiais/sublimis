# Cameras

In this section, we discuss cameras in further detail.

## Perspective Camera

The perspective camera renders a scene with perspective. For example, here
is a camera initialization:

```javascript
const sizes = {
	width: 800,
	height: 600,
};
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
	100,
	sizes.width / sizes.height,
	1,
	3,
);
camera.position.x = 2;
camera.position.y = 2;
camera.position.z = 2;
```

<Cube />

The syntax:

```
new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(fov, asp, near, far);
```

Let's look at each of these parameters in turn.

### Field of View

The larger the FOV argument, the more likely we are to distort the objects.
Beyond ${{75}^\circ,}$ objects begin looking very small. Often, it's best
to stay within the range of ${{45}^\circ}$ through ${{75}^\circ.}$

### Aspect Ratio

The aspect ratio argument is a ratio of width:height. We can think of this
as setting the width and the height of the render.

### Near & Far Parameters

The near and far parameters correspond to how close and how far the camera
can see. If an object is (1) closer than near, or (2) further than far,
then the object will not be seen.

A common mistake with this parameter is setting `near = 0.0001` and
`far = 99999`. Although this largely keeps objects within view, it almost
always introduces a bug called **z-fighting**. When two objects are too
close to one another along the ${z}$-axis, the GPU has difficulty
determining which of the two objects is &#8220;seen.&#8221; This leads to
the objects coming into conflict.

## Orthographic Camera

Unlike the perspective camera, the orthographic camera has no perspective.
Thus, objects seen through an orthographic camera have the same size,
regardless of their distance to the camera.

The syntax for initializing an orthographic camera:

```rust
new THREE.OrthographicCamera(left, right, top, bottom, near, far);
```

The arguments:

- The `left` parameter indicates how far left the camera sees.
- The `right` parameter indicates how far right the camera sees.
- The `top` parameter indicates how far up the camera sees.
- The `bottom` parameter indicates how far down the camera sees.
- The `near` parameter provides how &#8220;close&#8221; an object is to the
  camera. Any object closer than this value will not be seen.
- The `far` parameter sets how &#8220;far&#8221; the object is to the
  camera. Any object farther than this value will not be seen.

With the orthographic camera, we want to think of the camera's field of
view as a cube. What it sees directly in front of it is a square, and the
object lies on that square. Compare that with the perspective camera, which
has a field of view akin to a cylinder. Because of this, the orthographic
camera must know the how far left, right, top, and bottom we render.
Anything beyond those points is not seen. Furthermore, just like the
perspective camera, we can include arguments for the parameters ${near}$
and ${far.}$

When using an orthographic camera, it's often the case that changes to near
and far can distort the shape. To prevent this from occurring, we want to
use the aspect ratio &mdash; the ratio of width:height. We then multiply
this ratio to the ${left}$ and ${right}$ arguments:

```javascript
const sizes = {
	width: 400,
	height: 400,
};
const aspectRatio = sizes.width / sizes.height;
const camera = new THREE.OrthographicCamera(
	-1 * aspectRatio,
	1 * aspectRatio,
	1,
	-1,
	0.1,
	100,
);
```

## Controlling the Camera

Because ThreeJS deals with both 3D objects and their movements, cameras
must be mobile. Think of a movie set. The camera operators move the cameras
here and there as needed. There isn't just one camera, or multiple cameras,
remaining in place.

One way to move the camera is through the cursor. For example, if the
cursor moves to the left, we want the camera to move left, if the cursor
moves right, the camera moves right, and so on.

To move the camera, we must know the coordinates of the cursor. If we run
the code below, we'll see that we get back the ${x}$-coordinates of the
cursor's position in real time:

```javascript
window.addEventListener("mousemove", (event) => {
	console.log(event.clientX);
});
```

And if we use the following function:

```javascript
window.addEventListener("mousemove", (event) => {
	console.log(event.clientY);
});
```

We get the ${y}$-coordinates of the cursor's position. The values we see in
the console are pixel values. This is not very useful. If the window gets
large enough, the values run into the thousands, and if the window gets
small enough (e.g., on a mobile device), we stay in the hundred range. A
much more useful metric would be one that keeps these values proportional.
For example, one metric would be using the values ${0}$ through ${1.}$ No
matter what the window size is, we stay within this range.

To begin, we'll store the values we need in an object:

```javascript
const cursor = {
	x: 0,
	y: 0,
};
window.addEventListener("mousemove", (event) => {
	cursor.x = event.clientX;
	cursor.y = event.clientY;
});
```

To keep these values within the range of ${0}$ to ${1,}$ we simply divide
the values by the size of our viewport:

```javascript
const sizes = {
	width: 400,
	height: 400,
};
const cursor = {
	x: 0,
	y: 0,
};
window.addEventListener("mousemove", (event) => {
	cursor.x = event.clientX / sizes.width;
	cursor.y = event.clientY / sizes.height;
});
```

Note that the `width` and `height` values above are not necessarily the
viewport's dimensions. They might be the dimensions for a `canvas` element.
In later sections, we will consider ways to obtain the actual viewport's
dimensions.

With the approach above, we're getting only positive values. What if we
wanted to have positive and negative values, similar to a Cartesian
coordinate system? The solution is to just subtract ${0.5:}$

```javascript
const sizes = {
	width: 400,
	height: 400,
};
const cursor = {
	x: 0,
	y: 0,
};
window.addEventListener("mousemove", (event) => {
	cursor.x = event.clientX / sizes.width - 0.5;
	cursor.y = event.clientY / sizes.height - 0.5;
});
```

Why ${0.5?}$ Because the values range from ${0}$ to ${1.}$ By subtracting
${0.5,}$ the range now becomes ${[-0.5, 0.5].}$ The difference between this
implementation and the Cartesian coordinate system is the moving the mouse
towards the top yields negative ${y}$-values, and moving the mouse towards
the bottom yields positive ${y}$-values. The ${x}$-axis works as expected
&mdash; moving towards the left, we get negative ${x}$-values, moving
towards the right, we get positive ${x}$-values.

Having these values, we can update the camera through the `tick()`
function:

```javascript
const tick = () => {
	camera.position.x = cursor.x * 2;
	camera.position.y = cursor.y * 2;

	renderer.render(scene, camera);

	window.requestAnimationFrame(tick);
};
tick();
```

Running all of the relevant code, we might notice that the camera acts odd.
If we move the cursor left, the camera moves right. If we move the cursor
right, the camera moves left. And if we move up and down, the object
appears to follow the camera. This is because of that earlier fact we
noted: In ThreeJS, the ${y}$-axis is negative towards the top, and positive
towards the bottom. This means we must invert the ${y-}$coordinate value:

```javascript
const sizes = {
	width: 400,
	height: 400,
};
const cursor = {
	x: 0,
	y: 0,
};
window.addEventListener("mousemove", (event) => {
	cursor.x = event.clientX / sizes.width - 0.5;
	cursor.y = -(event.clientY / sizes.height - 0.5);
});
```

If we want to make sure the camera is always looking at the center of the
cube (while still panning around):

```javascript
const tick = () => {
	camera.position.x = cursor.x * 2;
	camera.position.y = cursor.y * 2;
	camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3());

	renderer.render(scene, camera);

	window.requestAnimationFrame(tick);
};
tick();
```

Alternatively, we can simply pass the object's position as an argument to
`lookAt()`:

```javascript
const tick = () => {
	camera.position.x = cursor.x * 2;
	camera.position.y = cursor.y * 2;
	camera.lookAt(mesh.position);

	renderer.render(scene, camera);

	window.requestAnimationFrame(tick);
};
tick();
```

We still, however, have a limitation: We can't see behind the object. To
remedy this, we want to have the camera rotate around the object. And to
rotate the camera around the object, we're going to use trigonometry.

As we know, the trigonometric functions are cyclical. For both
${y = \sin
x}$ and ${y = \cos x,}$ the domain is ${\R,}$ and we can see that
it is cyclical by way of a table:

| ${x}$                | ${y}$ |
| -------------------- | ----- |
| 0                    | 0     |
| ${\dfrac{\pi}{2}}$   | 1     |
| ${\pi}$              | 0     |
| ${\dfrac{3\pi}{2}}$  | -1    |
| ${2 \pi}$            | 0     |
| ${\dfrac{5 \pi}{2}}$ | 1     |
| ${3 \pi}$            | 0     |
| ${\dfrac{7 \pi}{2}}$ | -1    |
| ${4 \pi}$            | 0     |

And for ${y = \cos x}$ we have:

| ${x}$                | ${y}$ |
| -------------------- | ----- |
| 0                    | 1     |
| ${\dfrac{\pi}{2}}$   | 0     |
| ${\pi}$              | -1    |
| ${\dfrac{3\pi}{2}}$  | 0     |
| ${2 \pi}$            | 1     |
| ${\dfrac{5 \pi}{2}}$ | 0     |
| ${3 \pi}$            | -1    |
| ${\dfrac{7 \pi}{2}}$ | 0     |
| ${4 \pi}$            | 1     |

Because of these oscillations, if we use ${\cos x}$ to represent the
${x}$-coordinate and ${\sin x}$ to represent the ${y}$-coordinate, we
essentially have coordinates all along a circle. Knowing these facts, the
question then, is, which axes do we move along? Because we aren't moving up
and down (we're just trying to see behind the object), the axes we will
travel are the ${x}$- and ${z}$-axis.

```javascript
const tick = () => {
	camera.position.x = Math.sin(cursor.x * Math.PI * 2) * 3;
	camera.position.y = cursor.y * 5;
	camera.position.z = Math.cos(cursor.x * Math.PI * 2) * 3;
	camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3());

	renderer.render(scene, camera);

	window.requestAnimationFrame(tick);
};
tick();
```

## Built-in Controls

The control we mentioned above is an example of a custom control. ThreeJS
also provides **built-in controls**. These built-in controls are:

- `DeviceOrientationControls`
- `FirstPersonControls`
- `FlyControls`
- `OrbitControls`
- `PointerLockControls`
- `TrackBallControls`

We examine each of these controls in turn.

### Device Orientation Controls

`DeviceOrientationControls` retrieve the device orientation as set on the
device, operating system, or browser. With this information, we can rotate
the camera based on orientation.

### Fly Controls

We can think of `FlyControls` as allowing us to move the camera as if we
were operating a fighter jet &mdash; we can rotate on all 3 axes (e.g.,
performing a barrel roll), as well as moving forward and back.

### First Person Controls

`FirstPersonControls` are similar to fly controls, but with restriction:
The <i>up</i> axis is fixed. Where fly controls allow us to do
&#8220;aerial tricks,&#8221; first person controls are more like a
Boeing-747 &mdash; it can look down, but there is an upper bound on how
much it can look up.

### Pointer Lock Controls

`PointerLockControls` are akin to the controls we see in a game like
Minecraft. We can look up, down, left, right, from a fixed position. Think
of this as operating the camera on the the Mars rover. We can see in all
directions, but only from a &#8220;locked&#8221; position.

### Orbit Controls

`OrbitControls` allow us to move in all directions, <em>except</em> below
the floor (a vertical angle limit). This is very much like operating a
drone or satellite. The camera &#8220;orbits&#8221; the object.

### Trackball Contrls

`TrackballControls` are similar to orbit controls, but do not have the
vertical angle limit we see with orbit controls.
