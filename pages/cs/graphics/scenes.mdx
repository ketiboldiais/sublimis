# Scenes

<Cube/>

To install ThreeJS, see the <Install/>. It's recommended to use ThreeJS via
Webpack. With the ThreeJS library available, we have access to a variable
called `THREE`. ThreeJS is structured with classes, and most of these
classes are accessible by importing the three module as named import (in
these materials we'll use the name`THREE`).

To actually display ThreeJS renderings, we must have some container that
houses all of the renderings. This is called a **scene**. More generally,
to display renderings, we need, at a minimum, the following:

- A scene
- An object
- A camera
- A renderer

The scene is akin to a movie set. It's where all of the objects, models,
cameras, lights, and more are placed. After we place everything we need in
that scene, we ask ThreeJS to render the scene. To create a scene, we write
the following:

```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
```

Writing the above, we've instantiated a scene. We can then place an
_object_ in that scene. An object is any geometric object, or more
generally, whatever it is what we want to render. It might be a cube, a
sphere, a model for a building, person, video game character, etc. For now,
we'll start with a basic cube.

An object is really an abstract term for a **mesh**. A mesh is a
combination of two things: (1) a **geometry**, and (2) a **material**. We
can think of a geometry as defining the object's boundaries in space (i.e.,
it's shape), and the material as defining how the object looks (i.e., it's
colors). More accurately, the geometry is an abstraction for writing the
instruction establishing the vertices discussed earlier. ThreeJS provides
numerous <Geometries/> and <Materials/> and . For our humble cube, we will
use the ThreeJS properties `BoxGeometry` and `MeshBasicMaterial`:

```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: "red" });
```

The values (1, 1, 1) can be interpreted as any unit &mdash; pixels,
kilometers, meters, etc. It's entirely up to us how we interpret those
units. However, once we establish an interpretation, it's imperative that
we use that interpretation consistently. This is because
&#8220;units&#8221; in ThreeJS come down to proportions. If we interpret
the cube as having a length, width, and height of 1 meter, respectively,
then we must use that interpretation when we place other objects in
relation to the cube.

For the material, notice that we passed an object. In later sections, we'll
see that materials can easily increase in complexity. And as we know, we
want to manage increased complexity with various data structures. In this
case, we use an object. For `color` property, we used a named color. We can
also use hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL values. Hexadecimal is the more common
color format, and we can write hexadecimal values directly:

```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });
```

With the geometry and material initialized, we can now initialize the mesh:

```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
```

We now have a mesh. To see this mesh, however, we must add it to the scene:

```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(mesh);
```

We now need a camera. Without a camera, we have no way of seeing what's in
the scene. ThreeJS provides many kinds of <Cameras />. For now, we will use
a camera called `PerspectiveCamera`:

```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(mesh);
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera();
```

Above, we initialized a new perspective camera called `camera`. The
perspective camera is designed to mimic the way the human eye sees. To get
the camera to work, we must provide the constructor a few parameters:

```rust
new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(fov, aspect, near, far)
```

Let's cover these parameters. First, the ${fov}$ parameter
(&#8220;Field-of-view&#8221;) sets the vertical vision angle &mdash; how
much we can see up and down. This might seem odd, as the intuitive response
is that our field of view is often measured in terms of the horizontal
visual angle (i.e., our peripheral vision). The game development community
(often at the forefront of computer graphics), however, has found that both
development and user experience is much more intuitive when working with
vertical visual angles.

With a larger field of view, we see everything everywhere, but the things
we see appear distorted. With a smaller field of view, we see things as if
we're peering through a scope. There are less things visible, but the
things that are visible are proportionate and close.

Using the above information, we now write:

```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(mesh);
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75);
```

The second parameter, ${asp}$, establishes the aspect ratio. This is simply
the width of the renderer divided by its height. We will see the renderer
shortly, but for now, we can think of the width and height as the
dimensions of the renderer. It's considered best practice to initialize the
dimension values in an object, then refer to the values via object
notation:

```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(mesh);
const sizes = {
	width: 800;
	height: 800;
}
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
	75,
	sizes.width / sizes.height
)
```

We will examine the other parameters in later sections. But with just the
two parameters above, we now add the camera to the scene:

```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(mesh);
const sizes = {
	width: 800;
	height: 800;
}
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
	75,
	sizes.width / sizes.height
)
scene.add(camera);
```

The final step is to _render_ the scene. This is what sets off the process
for drawing everything we've written. The function that performs the render
is called a **renderer**. When the renderer is called, the scene is
rendered from the camera's point of view, and the result is returned. That
result is then drawn into the HTML element selected to display the result.
In our case, we will use a `canvas` element. We can either write the
`canvas` element directly in our HTML document, or have ThreeJS do it for
us. To simplify things, we'll write the `canvas` element directly:

```html
<canvas></canvas>
```

Ignore the class attribute `"webgl"` for now. We will use it in a later
section. The main point is that there's a `canvas` element inside the HTML
document we're working with. The HTML `canvas` element itself is just an
element that allows us to draw objects in via JavaScript. By calling the
renderer, ThreeJS will use WebGL to draw the render inside the `canvas`.

That said, before we add the renderer, we must first create it. Like
`material` a renderer can easily grow complex. Accordingly, we use an
object containing several properties. One of those properties is the
`canvas` element. Thus, we must target the `canvas` element and store it as
a property:

```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(mesh);
const sizes = {
	width: 800;
	height: 800;
}
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
	75,
	sizes.width / sizes.height
)
scene.add(camera);
const canvas = document.querySelector('.webgl');
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
	canvas: canvas;
});
```

If we refresh the HTML page, we'd see a black rectangle, with no cube in
sight:



To see our cube, we must first give the renderer a size:

```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(mesh);
const sizes = {
	width: 800;
	height: 800;
}
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
	75,
	sizes.width / sizes.height
)
scene.add(camera);
const canvas = document.querySelector('.webgl');
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
	canvas: canvas;
});
renderer.setSize(sizes.width, sizes.height);
```

When we resize the renderer, we resize the canvas. This is why we see the
size of the black rectangle increase. Next, we must call the `render()`
function:

```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(mesh);
const sizes = {
	width: 800;
	height: 800;
}
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
	75,
	sizes.width / sizes.height
)
scene.add(camera);
const canvas = document.querySelector('.webgl');
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
	canvas: canvas;
});
renderer.setSize(sizes.width, sizes.height);
renderer.render(scene, camera);
```

Even with the code above, we still don't see a cube. Why? Because the
camera is actually _inside_ the cube. We have to move the camera away from
the cube. To move the camera &mdash; and really, to move any object &mdash;
we use the following properties (where ${obj}$ is an object):

1. `obj.position`
   - The `position` property is an object literal with three properties:
     `x`, `y`, and `z.` Each of these properties represents the ${x}$-,
     ${y}$-, and ${z}$-axis values respectively.
   - Note that axis interpretation varies widely across libraries. In
     ThreeJS, the ${x}$-axis is interpreted as left-right movement, the
     ${y}$-axis as up-down movement, and the ${z}$-axis is forward-backward
     movement.
2. `obj.rotation`
   - The `rotation` property represents an object's local rotation, in
     radians.
3. `obj.scale`
   - The `scale` property represents an object's local scale.

Knowing these properties, we want to move the camera backwards (i.e.,
towards us):

```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(mesh);
const sizes = {
	width: 800;
	height: 800;
}
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
	75,
	sizes.width / sizes.height
)
camera.position.z = 3; // move the camera
scene.add(camera);
const canvas = document.querySelector('.webgl');
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
	canvas: canvas;
});
renderer.setSize(sizes.width, sizes.height);
renderer.render(scene, camera);
```

We should now see a red square. It is actually a cube, we just need to move
the camera to the right:

```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(mesh);
const sizes = {
	width: 800;
	height: 800;
}
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
	75,
	sizes.width / sizes.height
)
camera.position.z = 3; // move the camera back
camera.position.x = 2; // move the camera right
scene.add(camera);
const canvas = document.querySelector('.webgl');
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
	canvas: canvas;
});
renderer.setSize(sizes.width, sizes.height);
renderer.render(scene, camera);
```
