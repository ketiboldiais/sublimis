# Program Counter


With RAM, we have full-fledged memory. And now that we have memory, we can store _instructions_. That's a tall order, so before we address that problem, let's tackle a smaller problem: How do we get the computer to remember where it was in a set of instructions?

To understand why this problem should be addressed, suppose we had a robot called _Bap_. Bap is a mechanical chef &mdash; provide a recipe, and Bap executes. Suppose Bap is given the following set of instructions:


1. Heat skillet.
2. Get egg.
3. Crack egg into skillet.
4. Wait 4 minutes.
5. Remove egg and put into plate.

Bap executes the first step and heats the skillet. After a few minutes, we hear the fire alarm go off. Running to the kitchen, we see a cloud of smoke, the robot staring into a blackening plate. What happened? Bap never left the first step; it had no idea which of the steps to execute next. All Bap knows is that there's some instruction with a number next to it.


The __program counter (PC)__, or more generally, a __counter__, is a chip that solves this problem. The idea is simple: There's a large screen next to the robot, displaying a number. That number corresponds to the instruction's number. When the screen displays ${0,}$ Bap executes step ${0;}$ screen displays ${1,}$ the robot executes step ${1;}$ screen displays ${2,}$ execute step ${2;}$ and so on. That screen is program counter.


Program counters are not limited to just incrementing its current count. In the algorithm above, if the counter ends at `4`, Bap will cook just ${1}$ egg. But what if we wanted Bap to cook a hundred?  Well, we just reset the counter to a particular number after `4`. That is, once the counter reaches `4`, reset it to `2` (not `0`, since the skillet is already heated). In this way, we can get as many fried eggs as we'd like.


From our iron chef, we see that the program counter provides a feature we don't have yet: Providing the computer a way to keep track of which instruction should be _fetched_ and _executed_ next. To do so, the PC has three operations:


1. reset(): Fetch the first instruction (`PC = 0`).
2. next(): Fetch the next instruction (`PC++`).
3. `goto(${n}$)` Fetch the instruction ${n}$ (PC = ${n}$).

The PC's implementation:

```verilog
module PC(in[16], load, inc, reset);

	input  in[16], load, inc, reset;
	output out[16];

	PARTS:
		Mux16(a=in, b=false, sel=reset, out=in1);

		Or(a=load, b=reset, out=sw1);
		Mux16(a=loopOut, b=in1, sel=sw1, out=registerIn);

		Or(a=sw1, b=inc, out=regload);
		Register(in=regsterIn, load=registerLoad, out=registerOut, out=out);

		Inc16(in=registerOut, out=inc1);
		Mux16(a=registerOut, b=inc1, sel=inc, out=loopOut);

endmodule;
```
