# Logic Gates

A **logic gate** is a device that implements some functionality that can be
modeled with Boolean functions. There are two kinds of logic gates:
**elementary gates** (gates that implement a strictly Boolean operation)
and **composite gates** (gates that a functionality beyond a strictly
Boolean operation, e.g., addition, multiplication, etc.). We begin by
covering a few elementary gates.

Below are the schematic represenations for the `AND`, `NOT`, and `OR`
gates:

The diagrams above are _schematic specifications_ of the gates. We can also
provide **functional specifications** and **truth table specifications**.

$$

### NAND Gate

The `NAND` gate can be implemented as by wiring together and `AND` gate and
a `NOT` gate:

![The NAND gate's schematic](https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1653168591/cs/nand_gate_schematic_axgn0w.svg)

The `NAND` gate representation above is the **interface**. It's what the
user actually interacts with. The gates inside the box—the `AND` and `NOT`
gates comprising `NAND`—are the **implementation** of `NAND`.

`NAND`'s specifications are as follows:

		height={150}
	/>
</figure>

```verilog
	if (a==1 and b==1)
	then out=0 else out=1
```

## Circuit Implementations

We might be wondering, how exactly do these gates work physically? This is
a fair question, because the gate schematics are really an abstraction for
a **circuit**. Accordingly, the implementations for elementary gates are
actually circuits. For example, the `AND` gate can be represented with a
schematic specification of its **circuit implementation**:

![The AND circuit](https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1653168682/cs/and_circuit_szgr6v.svg)

For the `OR` gate:

		alt="An OR gate"
		width={150}
		height={150}
	/>
</figure>

In this volume, we don't deal with these circuit implementations. They are
presented here purely to satisfy any curiosity we might have about how
these gates actually work in reality. The design and implementation of
these circuits falls within the realm of electrical engineering, not
computer science.

### Hardware Description Language

When we're asked to design a logic gate, we want to always ask for as much
information as we can. This means we always want to possibly construct a
truth table. For example, suppose the client asks for a gate that:

> Outputs `1` if and only if one of its two inputs is `1`.

Specifying this as a truth table:

<div id="xor_truth_table"></div>

This particular gate is called a **XOR gate**.

With this information, we can specify this design through **hardware
description language (HDL)**—a computer language for describing the
structure and behavior of digital logic circuits. For the `XOR` gate, we
would write the following in an `.hdl` file:

```verilog
/** Xor gate: out = (a And Not(b)) Or (Not(a) And b)) */
CHIP Xor {
	IN a, b;
	OUT out;

	PARTS:
	// Implementation goes here
}
```

In the code above, the implementation (currently noted as "Implementation
missing") is written in an HDL stub file. To write this implementation,
we'll need to come up with a way to implement `XOR` using the gates we
already have, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and `NAND`.

To do so, we take a closer look at the truth table. In this case, we see
that there are only two cases where the output is `1`:

1. `a` is `0` and `b` is `1.`
2. `a` is `1` and `b` is `0`.

Accordingly, we have the diagram:

![The XOR gate's implementation](https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1653168850/cs/XOR_implementation_vdyrne.svg)

In our `hdl` file, we write:

```verilog
/** Xor gate: out = (a And Not(b)) Or (Not(a) And b)) */
CHIP Xor {
	IN a, b;
	OUT out;

	PARTS:
	Not (in=a, out=nota);
	Not (in=b, out=notb)
	And (a=a, b=notb, out=aAndNotb);
	And (a=nota, b=b, out=notaAndb);
	Or  (a=aAndNotb, b=notaAndb, out=out);
}
```

The `hdl` file is really nothing more than a textual description of the
gate diagram.

## Buses

Computers often require manipulating groups of bits together. For example,
sending some sequence ${00101011}$ from one area to another would be much
more efficient if we could send it all together rather than sending it one
by one.

To help achieve this efficiency, we treat a group of bits as a single
entity called a **bus**. For example, suppose we want to add two ${16}$ bit
numbers. To do so, we build a gate called a **${16}$-bit adder**. Such a
gate requires two inputs that feed ${16}$ bits each, and output ${16}$
bits. Thus, the gate has ${32}$ wires feeding into it as input, and ${16}$
wires leaving it as output:

![A 16-bit adder](https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1653168946/cs/real_16_bit_adder_ducr5w.svg)

Instead of thinking about all of these wires individually, we abstract each
group of ${16}$ wires as a _bus_, corresponding to groups of ${16}$ bits:

![Abstracted 16-bit adder](https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1653168980/cs/16_bit_adder_jggyvc.svg)

## Gates from NAND

This section presents an overview of some common gates, all formed from the
NAND gate.

### Multiplexor

The `mux gate`, or **multiplexor**, is visualized as the following:

![The MUX gate](https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1653169040/cs/mux_gate_rfnjgs.svg)

The multiplexor takes three inputs: The usual `a` and `b`, and a `sel`
input. If `sel` is ${0,}$ the multiplexor outputs `a`. If `sel` is ${1,}$
the multiplexor outputs `b`.

The HDL description:

```verilog
if (sel==0)
	out=a
else
	out=b
```

The truth table:

The multiplexor also has an abbreviated truth table:

The multiplexor's HDL appears as follows:

```verilog
CHIP AndMuxOr {
	IN a, b, sel;
	OUT out;

	PARTS:
	And (a=a, b=b, out=andOut);
	Or (a=a, b=b, out=orOut);
	Mux (a=andOut, b=orOut, sel=sel, out=out);
}
```

### Demultiplexor

The **DMux gate**, or **demultiplexor**, is schematically represented as
follows:

![The DMux gate](https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1653169095/cs/dmux_gate_m0milb.svg)

We can think of the demultiplexor as the inverse of a multiplexor. It
receives a single input, and outputs either an `a` output or `b` output.
The hardware description:

```verilog
if (sel==0)
	{a,b}={in,0}
else
	{a,b}={0,in}
```

The truth table:

<div id="demux_truth_table"></div>

Using a demultiplexor and multiplexor together allows us to stream bits of
information efficiently:

![A MUX-DMux stream](https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1653169148/cs/mux_demux_stream_psbbrj.svg)

In the circuit above, the `sel` bits are connected to an _oscillator_
returning `0`s and `1`s alternatively. The output of the `Mux` is a single
stream of bits, which is then fed into the `DMux` where the original stream
is outputted. This allows us to transmit large messages as a single stream
of bits—far more cost-efficient than transmitting multiple streams.

### AND16

The **AND16 gate** is a ${16}$-bit `AND` gate. At its core, it really is
just an `AND` gate, but instead of just two single-bit buses as input, it
takes two ${16}$-bit bus inputs. This results in outputs like:

$$
	\begin{aligned} \texttt{a} &= 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 \\ \texttt{b} &= 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 \\ \hline \texttt{out} &= 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 \end{aligned}
$$

### Mux4Way16

The **Mux4Way16 gate** is a 4-way 16-bit multiplexor. In other words, a
multiplexor that takes four 16-bit buses as inputs, a 2-bit bus as a
selection input, and a 16-bit bus as output. The truth table:

<div id="mux4way16_truth_table"></div>
