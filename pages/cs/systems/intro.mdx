# Computer Architecture

The notes in this volume cover how computers are constructed and organized.
In many of the other volumes, we've worked at a very high level, discussing
idioms, data structures, algorithms, functions, iteration, inheritance,
polymorphism, recursion, and many more. In this volume, we will dig away at
those abstractions to see what grounds it all.
