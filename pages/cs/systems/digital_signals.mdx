# Digital Signals

Before we get to a functioning computer, we must assemble its components.
Before we assemble its components, we must understand Boolean logic from
the computer's perspective. And before we understand the computer's
perspective, we must understand what _bits_ are. And to understand what
bits are, we must study **signals**.

## What's a Signal?

If we look at the Great Wall of China, we see that it's not just some
massive, vertical wall. It has considerable thickness for people to travel
along the wall. Every few meters or so, there's a large tower.

These large, protruding structures are called _beacon towers_. They were
used for storing supplies and sheltering soldiers. But more importantly,
they were used to transmit messages. When a sentinel saw intruders
approaching during the day, the soldier would set smoke (if the threat
occurred during the day) or light a fire (if the threat occurred at night).
The sentinel in the neighboring tower would see the signal and perform the
same, that tower's neighboring tower would see the signal and do the same,
and that tower's neighbor, etc.

The message transmitted was simple: Smoke or fire, there was an intruder;
else, just another day along the wall. This was a fairly limited form of
communication. More complicated messages like

"Running low on water at tower ${5}$" had to be delivered by messenger.
Nevertheless, China's beacon towers present a straightforward introduction
to the notion of a _signal_.

Mathematically, a **signal** is just a function ${s(t).}$ What separates it
from other functions, however, is what it represents: The variation of some
_physical quantity_ with respect to some parameter, most commonly _time_.
Because it measure some physical quantity, the key characteristic of a
signal is that its range is an _interval_ &mdash; a set consisting of real
numbers between some real number ${a}$ and a real number ${b.}$

For example, for the soldiers along the Great Wall, the signal can be
mathematically modeled as:

$$
	s(\text{beacon}) = \begin{cases} \text{intruder}~~~~~~~~~~\text{if}~~~\text{beacon} \in \{ \text{fire, smoke} \} \\ \text{no intruder}~~~~~\text{else} \end{cases}
$$

We can write this more abstractly. Denote ${\text{beacon}}$ as ${b,}$ the
existence of a fire or smoke as ${1,}$ and the nonexistence of a fire or
smoke as ${0:}$

$$
	s(b) = \begin{cases} \exists(\text{intruder}) ~~~ b=1 \\ \nexists(\text{intruder}) ~~~b=0 \end{cases}
$$

From this definition of a signal, we can see that many kinds of functions
qualify as signals. For example, if we took temperature readings on a
particular from ${8}$AM to ${8}$PM and found that the trendline resembled a
graph ${2t^2,}$ the function ${T(t) = 2t^2}$ constitutes a signal. Plug in
a time, and we get back a _variation_ of the temperature. This is the
defining characteristic of a signal: it's a function that returns some
_object_ &mdash; perhaps a number, or the fact that an intruder is
approaching &mdash; from an interval.

For electronics, e.g., a computer, a signal is a function representing some
variation in a measurement of electricity with respect to time. That
measurement could be electrical voltage or a pulse of current. For our
purposes, we'll think of the measure in terms of current pulses, but
really, it doesn't matter. The important point is that the measurement is
one among a finite set of possible measurements.

## Analog versus Digital

The terms _analog_ and _digital_ refer to the signal's codomain. For
example, the sine function, ${y = \sin(x),}$ is an **analog signal**. Its
codomain is the interval ${\{ y \in \R \mid -1 \leq y \leq 1 \}.}$ We
classify it as an analog signal because it can output infinitely many
signals &mdash; there are infinitely many real numbers between ${-1}$ and
${1.}$

<Plot functions={[{ f: (x) => Math.sin(x), color: "firebrick" }]} />

A **digital signal**, however, restricts the codomain to a subset of the
analog signal's codomain. For example, consider the function:

$$
	s(t) = \dfrac{\sin(2 \pi f t)}{2\lvert \sin(2 \pi f t) \rvert } + \dfrac{1}{2}
$$

Where ${f,}$ the _frequency_, is ${1,}$ and ${t}$ is the time. This
function results in a **square wave** whose graph appears as:

<Plot
	functions={[
		{
			f: (x) =>
				Math.sin(Math.PI * x) / (2 * Math.abs(Math.sin(Math.PI * x))) +
				0.5,
			color: "#29C7AC",
		},
	]}
	domain={[-5, 5]}
	range={[-5, 5]}
	precision={1000}
	strokeWidth={2}
/>

Notice that we've now restricted the codomain even further: The signal can
only be ${0}$ or ${1.}$ This is a key feature of digital signals, and it is
what's used by electronic devices to make the measurements of electricity
we mentioned earlier. Interpreting the graph above, the ${y}$-axis is the
electrical measurement &mdash; perhaps volts (units of voltage) or amperes
(units of electric current) &mdash; and the ${x}$-axis is time.

In essence, restricting the domain means we're restricting the number of
possible outputs. And by restricting the number of possible outputs to just
two &mdash; ${0}$ or ${1}$ &mdash; we enter a world where pretty much
everything is black and white, true or false. This greatly reduces
complexity, because now we can model everything with a switch

This single switch is called a **bit**. Using enough of these bits, we can
implement Boolean and arithmetic operations. And from these basic
operations, we can emulate _memory_, all the way up to a full-fledged,
functioning computer.
