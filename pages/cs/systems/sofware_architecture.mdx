# Software Architecture

In designing software systems, there are six core considerations:

1. **Performance.** A large software system like might serve millions of
   users at any given moment. For the entire system to work, the system's
   architects must answer questions like: How much time should it take for
   this request to process? How much time do we have for this response to
   return? Ideally, the system has a small amount of _latency_ and amount
   of _throughput_.
2. **Scalability.** Without more, a software system that works for ten
   users isn't guaranteed to work for a hundred, let alone a million. The
   scalability consideration answers questions like: Can this system
   millions of users? Millions of _simultaneous_ requests?
3. **Reliability.** Software systems will fail. The reliability
   consideration addresses ways to prevent or lessen the likelihood of
   common failures, how to respond to failures, and how to mitigate damages
   from failures. Questions include: How do we make the system more
   resilient to failures? What should the system do if a particular failure
   occurs?
4. **Security.** Modern software systems are almost always manipulating
   user-input data somehow. That manipulation may involve transferring such
   data from one point to another. And where there's data movement, there's
   a security risk. As such, software architects must consider questions
   like: How should the system transfer this data? What should the system
   do with accumulated garbage? How should the system dispose of data? The
   security consideration has grown particularly significant in recent
   years, given the current trend of increasingly stricter privacy laws.
5. **Deployment.**
