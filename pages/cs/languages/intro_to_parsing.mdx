# Introduction to Parsing

Suppose we have the following expression:

```rust
10 + 5
```

This expression is called a **binary expression** — it consists of two
operands, `10` and `2`. Viewing it as a tree:

<PTree
	data={[[`+`], [`+`, `10`, `5`]]}
	height={100}
	width={120}
	containerWidth={40}
	containerHeight={35}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
/>

More generally, binary expressions have the form:

<PTree
	data={[[`operator`], [`operator`, `operand`, `operand`]]}
	height={100}
	width={120}
	fontSize={7}
	containerWidth={40}
	containerHeight={35}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
/>

We can encapsulate this structure in code with some `struct`:

```rust
struct expression {
	type: 'binaryExpression',
	operator: '+',
	right: 5,
	left: 10
}
```

Now suppose we have this expression:

```rust
	10 + (3 ⨉ 1)
```

This, too, is just a binary expression:

<PTree
	data={[[`+`], [`+`, `10`, `⨉`], [`⨉`, `3`, `1`]]}
	height={100}
	width={120}
	containerWidth={40}
	containerHeight={35}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
/>

So, how do we represent this structure above in terms of code? In other
words, how do we take a string consisting of the expressions we've seen,
and structure it in such a way that it yields the visualization above? The
answer is through a ~lexer~.

## Tokens

The expressions we've seen consist of characters. For example, for the
expression ${10 + (3 \times 1),}$ we have the characters:

<Sequence
	data={[
		{ val: "1", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "0", focus: "red" },
		" ",
		{ val: "+", focus: "red" },
		" ",
		{ val: "(", focus: "red" },
		{ val: "3", focus: "red" },
		" ",
		{ val: "⨉", focus: "red" },
		" ",
		{ val: "1", focus: "red" },
		{ val: ")", focus: "red" },
	]}
/>

Above, the red squares indicate characters that have inherent meaning
(according to some language). The whitespace characters — the white boxes —
have no meaning in our language. When we give the red-boxed characters
meaning, they become ~tokens~.

Stripping all of the whitespaces, the string we're working with is:

```rust
10+(3⨉1)
```

We'll start by creating a class called `Lexer`.[^language_note]

[^language_note]:
    The examples used in this volume employ pseudocode to keep the
    discussion general. The pseudocode, however, was constructed with
    JavaScript in mind.

```rust
class Lexer:
	private:
		stream = "";
		cursor = 0;
```
