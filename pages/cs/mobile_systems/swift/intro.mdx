# Introduction

When we create a new project in XCode, we are automatically given several files and directories. Supposing the appplication's name is `foo`, we have: (1) `fooApp.swift`; (2) `ContentView.swift`; (3) a directory called `Assets.xcassets`; (4) `Info.plist`; (5) a directory called `Preview Content`; and (6) a directory called `Products`. All of these files and directories are nested under an application icon named `foo`.

First, if we click on the icon `foo`, we can see a variety of preferences. We can modify these preferences as needed. These changes are directly then reflected in the `Info.plist` file. For most projects, these high-level modifications are handled through the pane presented in the `foo` application icon, rather than through `Info.plist`. Of course, we are free to modify `Info.plist`.

Next, if we click on the `fooApp.swift` file, we see the following content:

```swift
import SwiftUI

@main
struct fooApp: App {
		var body: some Scene {
				WindowGroup {
						ContentView()
				}
		}
}
```


Generally, we make very few changes to this file. What we should look familiar is the `@main` symbol. This is similar to a `main()` function, as found in languages like Java and C. Ignoring the other parts of the code, we can see that inside the `struct` is something that says `ContentView`. For those familiar with object-oriented programming, this is an instance of `ContentView`. For those unfamiliar with object-oriented programming, the line `ContentView()` indicates some object, or thing, called `ContentView`. What is `ContentView`? To find out, we look at the next file, `ContentView.swift`.

Inside the `ContentView.swift` file, we can see the following code:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
		var body: some View {
				Text("Hello, world!")
						.padding()
		}
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
		static var previews: some View {
				ContentView()
		}
}
```

There's a lot going on in this code, so let's take it slowly. First, we have the line `import SwiftUI`. This tells Swift to use a package (source code outside our file) called `SwiftUI`.

Second, at the very bottom of the file, we see the code:

```swift
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
	static var previews: some View {
			ContentView()
	}
}
```

This block of code generates the previews we see in the simulator to the right.

Further down, we have the code `struct ContentView: View { ... }` (the ellipses indicating content). This tells Swift to create a `struct` named `ContentView` of type `View` (more on the `View` type later). Roughly speaking, a `struct`, short for &#8220;structure&#8221;, is a collection of variables. Inside the `struct`, we have the following code:


```swift
var body: some View {
	Text("Hello, world!")
			.padding()
}
```


This block of code creates a variable called `body`, with a type called `some View`. Why do we write `some View`? Because inside these block of code, there will be multiple `View` objects, and each of those `View` objects may be certain type of the type `View`. We can also place functions inside the `struct`:

```swift

struct ContentView: View {
		var body: some View {
				Text("Hello, world!")
						.padding()
		}

		func functionName() {

		}
}
```

This looks an awful lot like object-oriented programming. But, do not confuse a `struct` with a `class`. They are two very different things. For starters, there is no notion of inheritance with a `struct`. In fact, using a `struct` in Swift is more closely related to functional programming rather than OOP. Most of the underlying code in a Swift application &mdash; the user interface and the implementation &mdash; is written with a functional programming approach. When we connect all the various modules (e.g., connecting the user interface to its underlying logic), we use an object-oriented programming approach.

If `body` is some variable, then what are the braces following `some View {}`. These braces indicate a function. As we stated earlier, a large chunk of an application's code is done in functional programming. This means we will see functions throughout Swift code. In fact, the code inside the braces contains an implicit `return` symbol:

```swift
	var body: some View {
			return Text("Hello, world!")
	}
```

Indeed, placing a `return` in the example code, the code will still compile. Swift merely hides the `return` statement as a matter of syntactic sugar. The fact that the code above is a function reveals another insight: The variable `body` is not actually stored in memory. Instead, it is bound to a value that is calculated when the function (the code inside the braces) is executed. In other words, `body` has no value unless it is specifically referenced. Only when it is referenced does Swift evaluate the variable, which is done by executing the code inside the braces.

Inside that function, we have the line `Text("Hello, world!")`. A `Text()` is another kind of `View`, and more broadly, it is a `struct`. In fact, in the SwiftUI library, there's more than likely some code that looks like:

```swift
struct Text: View {
	var body: some View {
		// various statements
	}
}
```

This harkens back to a previous point on why we must write `some View`. Inside the function, there are more than likely various kinds of `View`s, and writing `some View` effectively tells the Swift compiler, "Heads up, there are some `View`s coming." By giving Swift this heads up, when the function inside the braces is executed, Swift can replace the `some View` with a `Text` type.

```swift
var body: text {
		return Text("Hello, world!")
}
```

Notice that we can add padding to the `Text("Hello, world!")`:

```swift
var body: text {
		return Text("Hello, world!")
			.padding(.all)
}
```

The code above can be rewritten as:

```swift
var body: text {
		return Text("Hello, world!").padding(.all)
}
```

Putting the two lines together, this should look familiar to those coming from object-oriented programming. This is, in fact, a function call (we avoid using the word method for now because `Text()` is a `struct`, not a class). The `.padding()` function is a function available to any `struct` that behaves like a `View`. In this case, `.padding()` is an argument &mdash; all sides.

By calling the function `.padding()` on the `Text() struct`, we receive a new entity that behaves like a `View`.
