# MVVM

The **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture** is a way of organizing —
or more generally, a design paradigm — an application's code. MVVM starts
with the premise that applications consist of two core parts:

<FlowChart
	data={`
	model[label="Model",width=0.3];
	view[label="View",width=0.3];
	viewModel[label="ViewModel",width=0.3];
	system[label="iOS",width=0.3];

    view->system[dir=both];

    subgraph cluster {
    	viewModel->view[dir=both];
    	viewModel->model[dir=both];
    	label="Application";
    		fontsize=8;
    };

`} width={350} height={250} />

The **View** is where all of our user-interface (i.e., frontend) code
lives. The **Model** is where all of our logic (i.e., backend) code lives.
The **ViewModel** serves as a liason betwen the View and the model, binding
the View to the Model.

## The Model

The Model is completely UI-independent. Under MVVM, no UI code is ever
placed in the model. For example, we would never import `SwiftUI` into a
model source code file.

The only code we should see in the model is code that relates to:

1. data, or
2. logic

One way to think about this: If another developer wanted to know what our
application does, they would first look at the source code files inside our
`Model` directory.

For example, consider a Chess game app. The `Model` would contain code
about the following:

- Verifying that move is valid
- Calculating how many points have accumulated
- Keeping track of which pieces are still on the board
- Storing the amount of time elapsed

Importantly, the model is the _single source of truth_ for our
application's data. No other part of the application, outside the model,
keeps data. This is a strict principle under MVVM. Other parts of the
application are not even permitted to store that data inside a local
variable.

By ensuring that there's one, and only one, truth source, we don't have to
worry about two different versions of the truth. This prevents situations
like our Chess game's UI showing that the time elapsed is an hour while our
model says it's only been five minutes.

## The View

The View is where all of our UI code is placed. If another developer wanted
to know how our application looks the way it does — e.g., buttons with
shadows, a list view, colors, etc. — they would look inside the `View`
directory.

Using our chess game app again, the `View` would contain code about:

- what a particular piece looks like
- the board's alternating square colors
- what the point board looks like

As mentioned earlier, the View cannot contain data. That's the Model's
prerogative. But wait. Isn't the View in charge of showing data like the
scoreboard or time? Yes, it is. For the View to render the current score or
time, it needs that data. And to get that data, it must **ask** for it.

Because the View never holds data, it is always a current state reflection
of the model. At no point does it show data other than what the model
currently holds.

<FlowChart
	data={`
	model[label="Model",width=0.3];
	view[label="View",width=0.3];

    model->view[label="data flow", fontsize=8];

`} rankdir="LR" height={100} width={220} />

In other words, the data the View receives is ~read-only~. This means that
the View has no _state_. If there ever is a state (indicated by the use of
`@State`) inside the View, it's purely for self-management.

For example, perhaps our Chess game has various _themes_ — when one player
gets closer to a checkmate, their pieces start glowing. That's a particular
theme, and the View must use an `@State` to toggle it.

But, the data indicating that a player is getting closer to a checkmate
lives entirely in the model. Thus, the `@State` used to toggle the theme is
purely transient. Any `@State` variables we see in the View don't store any
data about the player approaching a checkmate.

### The Body Variable & the View

Recall the starting template of a Swift application:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, world!")
            .padding()
    }
}
```

The `body` var reflects the current state of the model, and it's the point
of contact between iOS and our application. iOS will not look anywhere else
for what to do. Additionally, iOS can ask for the value of that `body`
variable at any time. Now, we know that Views are immutable. This means
that there's no other way to change a View — how our application looks —
without changing the `body` variable's value. Thus, every change we want to
render in the UI must be done by reconstructing the `body` variable anew.

Because of this fact, frontend code in SwiftUI is declarative. This, does,
however, pose a challenge. If some data changes in the model, everything in
the View that depends on the changed data must return their `body`
variable.

How do we get those `body` variables? Well, we could impose a rule: If a
change occurs in the model, all Views must return their `body` variables.
This would ensure we get the `body` variables, but it's horribly
inefficient. Some of those Views almost certainly do not render differently
because of the model's change. Thus, what we really want is a rule that
only asks for a `body` variable from a View that actually depends on the
changed data.

This is the problem that MVVM solves. The whole idea behind MVVM is to
ensure the following:

1. Separting the application's Model and View,
2. establishing a one-way connection from the Model to the View, and
3. ensuring that only Views impacted by a change in the Model are rebuilt.

This is done by the **ViewModel**.

## The ViewModel

<FlowChart
	data={`
	graph[pad="0.3",nodesep="1",ranksep="1"];
	model[label="Model",width=0.3];
	view[label="View",width=0.3];
	viewModel[label="ViewModel",width=0.3];

    model->viewModel[label="data change",fontsize=8];
    viewModel->model[label="modify Model",fontsize=8];
    viewModel->view[label="announce change",fontsize=8];
    view->viewModel[label="user intent",fontsize=8];

`} rankdir="LR" width={580} height={160}/>

The ViewModel has several duties job:

1. **Binding**. The ViewModel binds the Model to the View, such that
   changes to the Model cause the View to react and get rebuilt.
2. **Interpreting**. For some applications, our Model might provide SQL or
   network data. These forms of data can be complicated, and we don't want
   our Views performing data processing to render. Accordingly, the
   ViewModel can serve as a system for wrangling the data it receives from
   the model into a simpler format for the Views.
3. **Gatekeeping**. The ViewModel also serves as a guard. It ensures that
   access to the model — requests for data or indications that data inside
   the model should change — is proper.
4. **Tracking**. Ancilliary to the three roles above, the ViewModel must
   also track all of the changes in the model.

Because of the ViewModel's role, if the View ever needs data, it must send
its request to the ViewModel. If the model should change based on user
input, the View must send that input to the ViewModel.

From Role (4), the ViewModel has two behaviors: (a) It notices changes in
the model, and (b) it _publishes_ the fact that something has changed. Any
View interested in that change can listen to these publications. This is
similar to the _observer pattern_ in object-oriented programming. The Views
are all _subscribed_ to the ViewModel, and the ViewModel is constantly
_observing_ the Model.

This pattern is followed because the ViewModel should not have special
connections to its subscribers. It doesn't serve any one View — it serves
both the Model and the Views as a whole. It's up to the Views to subscribe
to the ViewModel. If a View (a) doesn't need data from the model or (b)
doesn't need to send data to the model, it doesn't subscribe. If it does
either of those two things, it subscribes.
